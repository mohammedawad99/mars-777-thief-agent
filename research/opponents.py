"""The benchmark opponents: deterministic, legal, and no better informed than us.

**An opponent that cheats produces invalid evidence**, so every policy here is
handed exactly one `Observation` - the same value type the production strategy
port receives, whose four members are the board, its own cell, its own quota and
its own lawfully folded scent belief. There is no field for the other actor's
cell, an unrevealed intent, a nonce, a future draw or the opponent's parameters,
so an omniscient opponent is not something this corpus could express.

**Deterministic without a shared random stream.** A policy that needs to break a
tie arbitrarily derives its choice from a seed and the position it is standing
on, so the same seed replays the same game and no policy can peek at another's
draw. `random` is never used.

**A police-side opponent may place barriers, because the rules let that role
and only that role place them.** Its placement rule is written here and is
deliberately simpler than any shipped policy: place when the lawful evidence on
a placeable neighbour beats the evidence where we would otherwise move. It is an
independent research policy, never a copy of another repository's production
strategy - `research` imports nothing from a sibling repository at all.

Every action returned here is revalidated by the same legality authorities the
counted agent uses; nothing in this file decides what is legal.
