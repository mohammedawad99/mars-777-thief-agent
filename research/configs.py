"""The benchmark configuration corpus, built only from source-legal values.

Appendix F classifies every parameter, and the class decides whether a benchmark
may vary it at all:

* **FIXED** - *"binding, unchangeable; deviation disqualifies"*. Never varied.
  Table 15 #1 movement set, Table 16 #1-#3 the whole scent model (0.9 source
  strength, 0.10 decay, 5x5 field), Table 17 scoring, Table 18 #1 six sub-games.
* **MINIMUM** - *"negotiable only in the direction that makes the game harder …
  never easing below the example value"*, and absent an agreement the example
  value is the default. So a benchmark may raise these and must include the
  example: Table 13 #1 grid **7x7**, Table 15 #2 quota **14**, #3 max moves
  **35**, #4 survival threshold **35**.
* **NEGOTIABLE** - free by agreement: Table 13 #5/#6 the two start cells.

**5x5 is not in this corpus and cannot be.** Table 13 #1 makes 7x7 a MINIMUM,
`domain.config_model.MIN_GRID_SIZE` refuses anything smaller, and a benchmark
measuring a board the tournament forbids would be measuring a different game.
