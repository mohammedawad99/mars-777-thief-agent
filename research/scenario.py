"""What a seed actually selects: a distinct, legal opening geometry.

The first benchmark this stage ran produced win rates of exactly `0` and exactly
`1/3`, and the reason was worth more than the numbers: **the seed changed
nothing**. Every policy in the corpus is a deterministic function of the board,
its own cell and its own belief, so sixty-four seeds replayed one game and the
confidence intervals treated sixty-four copies of one observation as sixty-four
observations. Measured directly, the seed altered the outcome in **0 of 42**
(family, configuration) cells.

So the seed now selects the one thing Appendix F leaves free and a benchmark
genuinely wants to vary: **the two opening cells**. Table 13 rows 5 and 6 are
`NEGOTIABLE` - *"the parties may agree any value"* - so varying them stays
inside the rules, and it varies the scenario rather than the physics.

One configuration keeps the source's own example geometry - police in the corner,
thief in the centre - so Appendix F's illustrated opening is measured too rather
than averaged away.
