"""Deterministic figures, drawn with the renderer this project already ships.

**No plotting dependency was added.** The GUI stage built a tested, headless,
deterministic rasteriser over a toolkit-free `Frame`, and a bar chart is
rectangles and text. Reusing it costs nothing to install, runs identically on
Ubuntu and Windows, and keeps the research figures inside the same coverage and
type discipline as everything else. `matplotlib` would have added a large
optional dependency whose absence on a runner would silently skip the very
tests that prove the figures regenerate.

**Grading-readable by construction.** Every figure carries a title, labelled
axes with units, the sample size, the baseline identity, and a scale that starts
at zero whenever proportions are compared - a truncated proportion axis
exaggerates differences, which is the one chart lie that matters here.
