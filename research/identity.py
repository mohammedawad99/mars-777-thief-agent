"""Exactly which strategy was measured, pinned so a result can be re-checked.

A benchmark number is meaningless without the identity of what produced it, and
a class name is not an identity: two revisions share it. So a baseline is
recorded as its module, its class, the SHA-256 of the source files that define
it, and the repository commit those files came from.

**Nothing here imports a strategy to describe it.** The composition root already
names the production policy; this reads the file, so a benchmark cannot silently
measure something the agent does not actually ship.
