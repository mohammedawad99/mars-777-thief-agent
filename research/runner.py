"""Sweeping the corpus: every opponent, every config, every seed, once each.

The sweep is a plain triple loop and is deliberately boring - the interesting
decisions were all made before it runs, in the seed bank, the opponent corpus
and the configuration corpus, none of which knows what is being measured.

**Scores come from the scoring authority.** `domain.scoring.score_for` is the
Appendix F Table 17 table the tournament uses; a research score invented here
could disagree with the one that decides the league, so none is.
