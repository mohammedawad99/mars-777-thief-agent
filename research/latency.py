"""How long one decision takes, measured at the surface production calls.

The number that matters is the time inside `choose_action`, not the time to play
a benchmark game: the tournament budget applies to a decision, and harness
bookkeeping is ours rather than the opponent's problem. So the strategy is
called directly here, on observations taken from a real game, and the harness is
timed separately and reported separately.

**A monotonic clock, and percentiles rather than an average.** A mean hides the
worst case, and the worst case is what a deadline actually meets.
