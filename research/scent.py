"""The lawful scent each side may fold, produced by the locked model.

Chapter 4's model is Appendix F **FIXED** in all three of its numbers - source
strength `0.9`, decay `0.10`, field `5x5` - so the benchmark uses the shipped
default and never varies it. What a side may fold is what the *other* side
emitted, one emission per completed round, exactly as `observed_field` requires
and `interpret_scent` folds.

**Each role keeps its own history of the opponent's emissions**, so neither can
read its own trail as if it were evidence about the other, and neither sees an
emission before the round that produced it is complete.
