"""One deterministic sub-game, adjudicated by the authorities production uses.

**No second engine.** Legality and both trajectories are decided by
`app.semantic_replay.Replay` - the same engine the live audit and the Replay
Viewer use; capture by `domain.terminal`'s own predicates; the end event by
`evaluate_terminal`; the lawful view by `observation_of`; the scent by the
locked model. What this module adds is the one thing none of them do: it asks
two strategies for an action and feeds their answers in.

**Capture is modelled exactly as the counted path produces it, which is
narrower than the rulebook allows.** `SubGameDriver.play_round` never passes a
`claim` to `open_turn`, and `StrategyPort` cannot express one - its return type
is `MoveAction | BarrierAction`. So no shipped strategy can declare a contact
capture, and the only captures reachable are `BAR-003` (a barrier placed on the
thief's cell) and `GAME-005` (a thief left with no traversable neighbour).
Modelling contact capture here would flatter the police with wins production
cannot obtain, and the research would be measuring a different game.

**Both actors commit against the same start state**, exactly as JDEC-016 §4
requires: each observes the board the round opened with, and both effects apply
afterwards.
