# TODO - group MaRs-777 (THIEF)

> **Status: DRAFT.**
> **Purpose:** Track outstanding foundation and project tasks.
> **Authoritative source:** book v3.0.0.
> **Note:** No requirement is approved merely because this file exists.

## Done
- [x] Stage 0A - environment / tooling / Git / GitHub preflight audit.
- [x] Stage 0B - local repository foundation.
- [x] Stage 0B.1 - final evidence audit (exact future-commit validation).
- [x] Stage 0C - private GitHub repository created under mohammedawad99; **SSH** origin configured; reviewed initial commit pushed to origin/main.
- [x] Stage 0C - first GitHub Actions CI run green (ubuntu-latest + windows-latest).
- [x] Stage 1-SYNC - reviewed COMMON Stage-1 specification baseline **synchronized** from Police locked commit `691280dc…` into `docs/spec/` (documentation only; adopted, not re-extracted here). See `SOURCES.md`, `DECISIONS.md` D15.

- [x] Stage 2A - architecture freeze: 21 architecture docs + 7 PRD blueprints; 91/91 requirements architecture-mapped; red-team blocking findings resolved.
- [x] Stage 2A-R - read-only lecturer reference audit (`rmisegal/Game-P2P-Cop-Chase` @ `960499fd`); reference classified NON-BINDING; book wins on keyed Step-0 auth.
- [x] Stage 2A-R2 - attachment/chatbot reconciliation (AE-01…AE-04, secondary provenance); compatibility profiles; **JDEC-014** result→declaration reference; field matrix **77 → 75** (result 13 → 11). Zero chatbot questions pending.
- [x] Stage 2A-CLOSE - stale-baseline sweep + `result_sha256` audit; architecture/compatibility baseline committed and pushed; CI green (Ubuntu + Windows).
- [x] Stage 2B - PRD-01…04 authored in full (reviewed).
- [x] Stage 2C - PRD-05…07 authored in full (reviewed); 91/91 requirements have exactly one primary owner.
- [x] Stage 2-CLOSE - **PASS**; CLOSE-F1 (series convention = negotiated metadata, **not** a declaration field) and CLOSE-F2 (declared MCP endpoint = stable group-level ingress) resolved with **no artifact-contract change** (matrix stays **75**); all 7 PRDs **APPROVED — PHASE 2 LOCKED**; implementation **NOT STARTED**.

## In progress
- [ ] Supervising review of the Phase-2 closure commit; then **Phase 3 — Deterministic Core Implementation**.

## Pending
- [ ] Branch protection / rulesets - **blocked**: unavailable on the current GitHub
      plan for private repos (Stage 0D). Needs Pro upgrade, org, or public-at-submission.
- [ ] Example-simulator review (non-binding).
- [x] PRD-01 game logic - authored and locked; implementation not started.
- [x] PRD-02 local FastMCP - authored and locked; implementation not started.
- [x] PRD-03 baseline strategy (**THIEF** role-specific) - authored and locked; implementation not started.
- [x] PRD-04 language & scent - authored and locked; implementation not started.
- [x] PRD-05 public network - authored and locked; implementation not started.
- [x] PRD-06 security & cryptography - authored and locked; implementation not started.
- [x] PRD-07 reporting, GUI, replay - authored and locked; implementation not started.
- [ ] Collaborator (Rawey7) access - pending explicit instruction.

_No game logic, JSON schema, protocol, strategy, or reporting code has been
implemented. Phase 2 is documentation-only._
