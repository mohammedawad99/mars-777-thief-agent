# Role Responsibilities — group MaRs-777

**Status: STAGE 2A ARCHITECTURE FREEZE — design only.**
**This repository implements the THIEF agent.** The POLICE sections below
describe the **opponent's** obligations: this agent must *understand and validate*
them, but must never implement or simulate them as authoritative truth.

## 1. Common protocol responsibilities (identical for both roles)

Both peers MUST:

- load a **byte-identical** signed config and verify `config_sha256` **and** the keyed
  config authentication before any counted move (GAME-001, INV-15, NDEC-004/007);
- perform the **Step-0** declaration with **keyed authentication** using the
  pre-supplied key (CRYPTO-006, INV-14);
- run **Commit → Ack → Reveal → Final Audit** every turn, with a fresh CSPRNG nonce
  withheld until final audit (CRYPTO-001/002/008/010);
- enforce **movement legality deterministically in code**, never via an LLM
  (LLM-001, GAME-003);
- honour deadlines, watchdog, rate-limits and backoff (STATE-004/005, NET-002/003);
- write append-only evidence enabling **independent replay** (REPLAY-001/002);
- produce a **self-contained** result and e-mail it as JSON; missing-from-either-side
  or contradictory reports ⇒ **0 to both** (REPORT-001/002, C-09, INV-11);
- never reveal private material early and never log secrets (SEC-001…006).

## 2. Information classification (the core privacy model)

Every datum an agent can touch is exactly one class:

| Class | Meaning | May reach Strategy? | May reach GUI? | May reach Log? | May reach Report? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LOCAL-TRUTH** | This agent's own authoritative facts | **Yes** | Yes (own view) | Yes | Aggregates only |
| **PUBLIC/SHARED** | Facts both peers legitimately hold | **Yes** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **BELIEF/INFERRED** | Estimates derived from permitted observations | **Yes** (as belief) | Yes, **labelled as belief** | Yes | No |
| **OPPONENT-PROVIDED** | Claims received over the wire, **unverified until checked** | Yes **after validation** | Yes, labelled | Yes (as received) | Only verified parts |
| **FORBIDDEN-TO-KNOW** | Opponent private truth not yet legitimately disclosed | **Never** | **Never** | **Never** | **Never** |

**Structural enforcement.** The forbidden class is not merely "not read" — it is
**never materialized in this process**. The Strategy Engine receives a purpose-built
`Observation` object (see `API_BOUNDARIES.md` → `StrategyPort`) that can only be
constructed from LOCAL-TRUTH + PUBLIC + BELIEF + validated OPPONENT-PROVIDED. GUI and
Logger consume **projections/events**, never the live domain aggregate. There is
therefore no in-process object from which opponent truth could be read, because it
was never received.

## 3. Datum-by-datum classification

| Datum | Class | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Own true position | LOCAL-TRUTH | Sole authoritative copy in Local Truth |
| **Opponent true position** | **FORBIDDEN-TO-KNOW** | Never requested, never stored; only *believed* position exists (GUI-001/002) |
| Public barriers | PUBLIC/SHARED | Openly and truthfully declared (BAR-001/002) |
| Scent observations | PUBLIC/SHARED (own reading) | Field parameters come from signed config (SCENT-002) |
| Hints (text) | PUBLIC/SHARED once revealed | Bounded by `hint_max_words`; may be a lie by design (LLM-004) |
| `intent` (truth/lie tag) | LOCAL-TRUTH until reveal | Sealed in the commitment; **is** the "verdict" (C-08) |
| Believed opponent position | BELIEF/INFERRED | Must be labelled as belief everywhere it surfaces |
| Commitment hash `H_commit` | PUBLIC/SHARED | Unkeyed SHA-256 over the sealed record |
| Nonce | LOCAL-TRUTH (secret) | Withheld until final audit (CRYPTO-002) |
| Revealed move | PUBLIC/SHARED after reveal | LOCAL-TRUTH before |
| Shared config | PUBLIC/SHARED | Byte-identical, hash- and auth-verified |
| Score | PUBLIC/SHARED | Derived only from Appendix F values + C-07 |
| Timeout/deadline state | LOCAL-TRUTH | Own clock; opponent's clock is never authoritative |
| Keyed-auth **key material** | **SECRET** (never any artifact) | Only non-secret `key_id` is stored (JDEC-013) |

## 4. THIEF responsibilities (this repository)

### POLICE (role-scoped obligations)

- Declare **openly and truthfully** every barrier placement and exact location
  (BAR-001, MUST; BAR-002, MUST NOT lie).
- Place a barrier only on a turn movement is forgone, on own or orthogonally
  adjacent cell; irreversible until game end (BAR-004).
- Respect the barrier quota from signed config (default 14, MINIMUM) (BAR-005).
- A barrier placed on the thief's current cell **counts as a capture** (BAR-003).
- **Never falsely declare a capture** (CRYPTO-005, MUST NOT) — false claim ⇒ score 0
  + technical loss, no appeal (PDF p.145, App E #22 "ללא יכולת ערעור").
- Pursue capture within `max_moves`; capture scoring cop 20 / thief 5 (GAME-006).

### THIEF (role-scoped obligations)

- Survive to the survival threshold (default 35, MINIMUM) for survival scoring
  (thief 10 / cop 5) (GAME-006/008).
- Emit scent per the signed pheromone model — the thief cannot suppress the physics
  the config defines (SCENT-001/002/003).
- Provide hints within `hint_max_words`, truthfully classified by `intent`
  (truth or deliberate lie) — the lie is legal, the **misclassification is not**.
- Never claim an illegal move or a barrier-blocked transit as legal.

**Role symmetry note.** Both roles share the *entire* protocol, crypto, reporting and
replay surface. The role difference is confined to: (a) which legal actions exist
(barrier placement is police-only), (b) win conditions/scoring perspective, and
(c) strategy objectives. Everything else is common by construction — which is why the
architecture documents are largely COMMON (see `ARCHITECTURE_SYNC_MATRIX.md`).

## 5. What this repository must NOT do

- Must not implement, import, or simulate the **POLICE agent's private
  decision-making** as authoritative.
- Must not read the sibling repository's runtime state, code, or strategy (TB-3).
- Must not request, derive, or store **opponent true position** (FORBIDDEN-TO-KNOW).
- Must not let GUI, Logger, Reporter, or Strategy reach forbidden data (§2).
