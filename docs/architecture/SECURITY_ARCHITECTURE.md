# Security Architecture — group MaRs-777

**Status: STAGE 2A ARCHITECTURE FREEZE — threat model and design only.**
**No secret value, key, credential, or endpoint token appears in this document or in
any repository artifact.**

## 1. Security posture

The opponent peer is **untrusted by design** (honest-but-verified at best, hostile at
worst). The architecture assumes every inbound byte may be malformed, replayed,
forged, or adversarially timed. Safety comes from **deterministic verification**, not
from trust — and the correct response to a failed verification is to **refuse counted
play**, not to degrade.

Trust boundaries: **TB-1** peer · **TB-2** process · **TB-3** repository ·
**TB-4** LLM advisor · **TB-5** evidence · **TB-6** secret (`SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3).

## 2. Threat table

| # | Threat | Boundary | Prevention | Detection | Failure mode | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | **Malicious opponent input** (illegal move/barrier, contradictory claim) | TB-1 | deterministic validator before any effect; strict schema | validator verdict | reject; possible technical loss per spec | received message + verdict |
| T2 | **Malformed MCP request** (bad types, extra/missing keys, oversized, deeply nested) | TB-1 | strict schema validation, size/depth caps, no dynamic eval | parse/validate failure | `E-PROTO-MALFORMED`, reject | truncated escaped payload |
| T3 | **Replayed request** (old commit/reveal re-sent) | TB-1 | turn-cursor guard `(sub_game, step)` + receiver-side phase admissibility; idempotency | cursor mismatch | `E-PROTO-STALE`, ignore | rejected id + cursor |
| T4 | **Nonce attack** (guessing, reuse, forced early disclosure) | TB-1/TB-6 | CSPRNG (`secrets`) fresh per commit; single custodian; release only at final audit | nonce/commit recompute | `E-NONCE-MISMATCH` ⇒ TAMPERED | commitment/reveal pair |
| T5 | **Config substitution** (peer plays a different config) | TB-1 | byte-identical canonical config; `config_sha256` equality **plus** keyed auth tag | hash or tag mismatch | `E-CONFIG-MISMATCH`/`E-AUTH-FAILURE` ⇒ **refuse counted play** | both digests, `key_id` |
| T6 | **Authentication failure / forged Step-0** | TB-1/TB-6 | keyed authentication with pre-supplied key; domain separation `step0`/`config`; non-self-referential tags | tag verify fails | refuse counted play | `key_id`, alg, verdict (**never key bytes**) |
| T7 | **Hash mismatch / log tampering** | TB-5 | canonical bytes; append-only log; commit-reveal | recompute at audit + independent replay | **TAMPERED — void, no appeal** (PDF p.75; REPLAY-002) | full audit bundle |
| T8 | **Resource exhaustion / DoS** (flood, huge payloads, slowloris) | TB-1 | token bucket, concurrency cap, bounded queue, size/time limits, backpressure | queue/limiter metrics, 429 counts | reject with backpressure; never unbounded growth | limiter counters |
| T9 | **Secret leakage** (key, credential, API key) | TB-6 | secrets only in environment; never persisted/logged/e-mailed; only `key_id` serialized | repository + artifact secret scans in CI | refuse to start if misconfigured | scan result (no values) |
| T10 | **Private-state leakage** (opponent truth or nonce reaching strategy/GUI/log/report) | TB-1/TB-5 | forbidden data never received; `Observation` wall; projection-only GUI; logger whitelist | leak-scan tests asserting absent keys | test failure blocks the gate | leak-test report |
| T11 | **Report tampering / one-sided reporting** | TB-5 | `result_sha256` over agreed core (stored outside it); dual matching reports required | digest comparison | **0 to both** (C-09, E-35, INV-11) | both result cores |
| T12 | **Prompt injection via peer text into the LLM** | TB-4 | peer text is data, never instruction; bounded sanitized context; output is advisory only and must pass the validator | validator rejection; anomaly metrics | fallback to deterministic path | sanitized advisor record |
| T13 | **Cross-repository contamination** (police↔thief) | TB-3 | separate processes, packages, venvs, repos; no cross-import; no shared runtime state | import/dependency tests; isolation audit | build/test failure | isolation audit output |
| T14 | **Supply-chain / dependency risk** | local | minimal pinned dependencies (`uv.lock`, `--frozen`); justify every addition | lockfile diff review | dependency change is reviewed | lock diff |
| T15 | **Endpoint exposure** (public tunnel abuse) | TB-1 | endpoint carries no secret; assume observable; all authority comes from keyed auth + hashes, not from URL secrecy | inbound reject metrics | rate-limit / reject | ingress metrics |

## 3. Cryptographic discipline (locked taxonomy — never conflated)

| Object | Exactly what it is |
|---|---|
| `H_commit` | **Unkeyed SHA-256 commitment** over the canonical sealed record |
| Step-0 authentication | **Source-required keyed authentication** with a pre-supplied key. `AuthProfile ∈ {HMAC_SHA256 (project default), ED25519 (attachment-example compatibility — AE-02, *not* SOURCE-MANDATORY)}`. **Plain unkeyed SHA-256 does NOT satisfy strict Step-0 producer authentication** |
| HMAC-SHA256 | **Project default / negotiated** primitive — **not lecturer-specified** |
| `config_sha256` | **Unkeyed** equality/integrity digest |
| Config authentication | **Distinct** auth/signature exchange, separate from `config_sha256`. Byte-identity + exchange semantic **SOURCE-REQUIRED**; **exact primitive SOURCE-UNSPECIFIED** — Step-0's explicit "pre-supplied key" wording is *not* transferred onto the looser config wording |
| `result_sha256` | **Result-content agreement digest** (mutual acknowledgement) |
| Git commit SHA | **Source-code identity**, not message authentication |

Rules: a bare hash never authenticates a producer; HMAC is never called an asymmetric
signature; SHA-256 is never called a signature; tags and digests are **never
self-referential**; `context ∈ {"step0","config"}` provides domain separation so a tag
cannot be replayed across object types.

## 4. Secure defaults

- **Fail closed**: integrity/auth failure ⇒ refuse counted play.
- **Least data**: never request what we are not permitted to know.
- **No secret in Git, JSON, logs, docs, e-mail, errors, or runtime evidence.**
- **Constant-time comparison** for digests/tags where the language provides it.
- **Bounded everything**: payload size, queue depth, retries, decision time, log size.
- **Deterministic verification** over trust, always.

## Stage 5-R8 — what protects the two facts SHA-256 cannot

The commit-reveal scheme protects everything inside `H_commit`. Two facts of a
real game sit outside it and needed their own protection.

**A capture claim and its answer are unsealed.** They are live interaction
facts: the claim is a question about a cell only the opponent knows, and the
answer is computed by the opponent from state nobody else can see. Neither can
be committed to in advance. The protection is **mutual retention**: both sides
keep the row they really saw, each discloses its own half at the final audit,
and each compares the other's half against its own. A peer that rewrites,
adds, drops, duplicates or reorders a row is refused before any verdict is
derived — not because the row is signed, but because two independent records of
the same event exist and must agree.

**A disclosed log can be internally consistent and still be fiction.** A peer
can seal a game it never played: a piece that teleports, a move through a
barrier, a snapshot listing a barrier nobody placed. Every one of those hashes
correctly. The protection is the **semantic replay**, which rebuilds the
sub-game from the config-locked start cells and the placements both sides
actually revealed, and judges each action with the same `domain.rules` /
`domain.barriers` code the mover was required to obey locally.

Neither mechanism transmits a position, a nonce or a verdict, and neither adds a
message, a tool, a port or an error identity. The one asymmetry worth stating
plainly: a false capture **declaration** is a legal move played badly and is
scored (technical loss, 0/0), while a false **answer** is a forgery and is
treated exactly as a failed digest is.

## Provider-call observation (Stage 9A-1C)

The API Gatekeeper records one observation per provider call: the operation
name, whether it waited, whether it was throttled, how many attempts it took,
how it ended, and how long it took. **It records no content.** No request body,
no header, no URL, no provider payload and no credential enters a
`GatekeeperCall`, so an observation is safe to print anywhere a log line is.

`config/rate_limits.json` carries limits only. It holds no token, no key and no
address, and a test asserts that the committed file contains none of those words.
The tunnel credential remains the operator's own agent configuration, which this
project never reads, and the peer key remains environment-only and unprintable.

## Replay Viewer input handling (Stage 9A-2A)

The viewer is the one component that reads files this project did not write, so
its reader is a boundary rather than a convenience.

- **Containment after resolution.** `--root` confines every path, and the check
  runs on the resolved path, so a symlink pointing outside the root is refused by
  the same rule that refuses `../`.
- **Bounded reads.** A file above 8 MB is refused before it is read; a complete
  six-game artifact set is a few hundred kilobytes.
- **Parsing only.** `json` and nothing else: no `pickle`, no `eval`, no `exec`,
  and nothing the evidence names is ever imported or executed.
- **Refusals are sentences.** Every malformed, missing or contradictory input
  ends in a `ReplayError` naming what failed; a traceback is never the user
  interface.
- **No secret is shown.** The viewer projects disclosed evidence — cells,
  barriers, actions, hints, commitments and nonced verification results — and
  never key material, a private belief or an internal runtime object.


## Graphical interface exposure (Stage 9A-2B)

A window is a new way for information to leave a process, so it is treated as an
exposure surface rather than as decoration.

- **No new network surface.** The live view is an **in-process** sink, not a
  socket: the runtime leaves a value in a one-slot box and a window in the same
  process reads it. No port is opened, no address is bound, and no module in
  `gui/` imports `socket`, `http`, `urllib`, `httpx`, `requests` or `ssl`.
- **No remote asset.** No CDN, no remote script, no web font, no analytics, no
  external image host. The only font is the bitmap face that ships with the
  imaging library, so a screenshot renders identically on another machine and
  nothing is fetched while drawing.
- **Nothing is executed.** `gui/` contains no `eval`, no `exec`, no `pickle` and
  no `subprocess`, and a structural test fails if one appears.
- **The live view cannot leak an advantage.** Its whitelist is `Observation` —
  the value the strategy itself is restricted to — so the window structurally
  cannot show an opponent position, a peer nonce, a reveal or a final-audit
  trajectory: there is no field one could arrive in. `GUI-002`'s sanction is
  disqualification, so this is enforced by shape rather than by discipline.
- **Belief is labelled, never disguised as a sighting.** Every heated cell
  carries its own numeric value and the panel states
  `belief (estimate) - not a sighting`.
- **The replay view is the only one allowed more**, and only because
  `PRD07-FR-023` grants it after the audit point. A structural test asserts that
  no live module so much as names the objective board state.
- **Committed screenshots carry no secret.** Both show development identities,
  disclosed evidence and verification words only — no token, no key, no private
  path and no live URL.

## Gmail reporting exposure (Stage 9A-2C)

Reporting adds the first component that holds a **live credential for a third
party**, so it is treated as the highest-value secret in the project.

- **The credential never enters the repository.** `credentials.json` and
  `token.json` were already in `.gitignore`, as Appendix A and rule 40 require,
  and a test asserts both that the rules are present and that neither file
  exists in the tree.
- **The credential never renders.** `GmailCredentials` overrides `repr` and
  `str` to `<withheld>`; refusals name the *file* and the *field*, never a
  value; the `Authorization` header is built at the last moment and appears in
  no log, no evidence document and no exception message. A test asserts that a
  raised failure carries none of the three secret values it was constructed with.
- **Least privilege is checked, not assumed.** A `token.json` claiming any scope
  other than `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` is **refused** rather
  than used, which is rule 30 enforced instead of documented.
- **Header injection is refused, not escaped.** A `game_id` is text a peer
  proposed, so every header component is validated for `\r`, `\n` and `\x00`
  before a message exists; a hostile identifier cannot append a `Bcc`.
- **The attachment cannot break its own envelope.** A result document containing
  the multipart separator is refused rather than serialised into a corrupt
  message.
- **A real send cannot happen by accident.** It requires an explicit opt-in, a
  credential path and an explicit recipient, all three; a credential that merely
  exists authorises nothing, and CI sets none of them.
- **The account cannot be spammed by our own bug.** The DOS detector latches the
  gate shut on a burst that can only be a loop, and does not reopen on a timer.
- **A delivery failure cannot rewrite a game.** The result artifact, the agreed
  digest and the winner are untouched by anything the provider does.
