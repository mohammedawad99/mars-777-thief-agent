# API / Port Boundaries — group MaRs-777

**Status: STAGE 2A ARCHITECTURE FREEZE — architecture-level ports only.**
**No Python signatures are fixed here.** Concrete FastMCP tool signatures are **not**
locked at this stage; they are negotiated/derived in Stage 2B–2C except where the
locked source already forces a field (e.g. `github_commit`, the four artifact names).

Ports are declared in `app.ports`; adapters live in `infra`/`protocol`; the
composition root wires them (`DEPENDENCY_RULES.md` D3/D4).

| Port | Caller | Implementation owner | Accepts | Returns | Failure contract | Sync/async | Determinism | Externally exposed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **GameRulesPort** | app (turn service, validator) | `domain.rules` | board state, proposed action, config | legal / illegal + reason | never raises for legality — returns a verdict | sync | **fully deterministic** | no |
| **ScoringPort** | app orchestrator | `domain.scoring` | outcome, config | per-role scores | pure | sync | **fully deterministic** | no |
| **StrategyPort** | app turn service | strategy plug-in | `Observation` (role-legal only) | `ProposedAction` (+ optional hint/intent, confidence) | must always yield a legal fallback; timeout ⇒ deterministic default | sync (bounded) | deterministic **given seed** | no |
| **BeliefPort** | app turn service | `domain.belief` | permitted observations | belief estimate | pure | sync | deterministic | no |
| **CommitmentPort** | app turn service | `protocol.commitment` | sealed record fields (8) — already-valid semantic values, never strings or dicts | `H_commit`; later a recompute **comparison result** | **port outcome** on a false comparison ⇒ `E-HASH-MISMATCH` (terminal). *Layer note (4E-R9-R1): this describes what the **consumer** sees. The underlying pure comparison primitive returns `False` and does **not** raise — a digest that differs is its correct successful result, not an error.* | sync | **deterministic** (canonical bytes) | hash only |
| **KeyedAuthPort** | config lock, declaration | `protocol.keyed_auth` | `context`, canonical core, `key_id` | auth tag / verify verdict | invalid ⇒ `E-AUTH-FAILURE`; **never returns key material** | sync | deterministic | tag only |
| **ConfigLockPort** | orchestrator | `protocol.config_lock` | proposed config | immutable locked config + `config_sha256` + tag | mismatch ⇒ refuse counted play | sync | deterministic | hash/tag |
| **PeerTransportPort** | app (via orchestrator) | `infra.mcp_client` + `infra.gatekeeper` | protocol message | peer response or typed transport error | retry/backoff per Gatekeeper; then `E-RETRY-EXHAUSTED` | **async** | **non-deterministic** (isolated) | yes (egress) |
| **PeerServerPort** | external peer | `infra.mcp_server` | inbound protocol message | protocol response | strict validation; reject malformed/stale | **async** | non-deterministic | **yes (ingress, untrusted)** |
| **ClockPort** | state machine, orchestrator, gatekeeper | `infra.clock` | — | monotonic now, deadlines, timers | timeout events | sync + callback | **injected** (fakeable in tests) | no |
| **LoggerPort** | all layers (via app) | `infra.logger` | structured evidence record | append confirmation | write failure ⇒ `E-LOCAL-DEFECT` (fail fast) | sync | append-only | no |
| **ArtifactStorePort** | orchestrator, reporter, replay | `infra.artifacts` | canonical artifact bytes | path + digest | I/O error | sync | canonical bytes | no |
| **ReplayPort** | audit / CI | `infra.replay` | artifact paths **only** | verification report | mismatch ⇒ `E-REPLAY-MISMATCH` | sync | **fully deterministic** | no |
| **ReportPort** | reporter | `infra.reporter` | finalized result artifact | delivery receipt | delivery failure retryable | async | — | yes (egress) |
| **TokenAccountingPort** | LLM adapter, reporter | `infra.metrics` | call cost/tokens | running totals | — | sync | monotonic counters | no |
| **GuiProjectionPort** | GUI | `infra.gui` consumer of app events | **projection events only** | — | render error is non-fatal | async (subscribe) | — | local UI only |
| **LlmAdvisorPort** | language/hint subsystem | `infra.llm` | bounded prompt context (no secrets, no forbidden truth) | suggested text/tag | failure ⇒ deterministic fallback | async (bounded) | **non-deterministic** (must not affect legality) | yes (egress, optional) |
| **SeriesLauncherPort** *(2A-R2)* | match operator | `app`/local launcher | series plan (sub-game index → role) | which independent role process to activate | refuses to launch if the role process is unavailable | sync | deterministic | no |
| **NonceSourcePort** *(5-R4P)* | app (outbound evidence runtime) | `protocol.secure_nonce` | — | a fresh `NonceValue` | a source that yields a value outside the frozen profile fails value construction; there is no fallback and no retry | sync | **non-deterministic by requirement** (CSPRNG, CRYPTO-010) | no — the nonce stays secret until `FinalNonceReveal` |
| **CompatibilityProfilePort** *(2A-R2)* | config lock, commitment, reporter | `protocol`/`infra` | negotiated profile ids (`AuthProfile`, `CommitmentCodec`, `ResultProfile`) | active profile set (read-only at match time) | unknown/weakening profile ⇒ refuse counted play | sync | deterministic | no |
| **SettingsPort** | infra composition root | `infra.settings` | — | local settings; secrets from env | missing secret ⇒ refuse start | sync | — | no |

## Port design rules

- **P1 — Observation is a wall.** `StrategyPort` accepts only an `Observation` built by
  `domain.observation`; there is no field on it that could carry opponent truth.
- **P2 — No port returns key material.** `KeyedAuthPort` returns tags/verdicts only.
## Peer operation contract (Stage 4E-R11)

Two integration blockers — the move-rejection response and the audit-material
exchange — were both waiting on the same missing thing: a peer **operation**
contract. This section freezes that layer. It defines *logical operations and
their result/error separation*; it does **not** define FastMCP decorators,
signatures or JSON schema, which stay deferred to Stage 2B-2C.

**O1 — Peer operations are logically request → response.** `async` is an I/O
implementation property, **not** a message-shape property, and the two were being
conflated. `CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` already settles it: outgoing peer calls are
*"**per request**, `async`, bounded … **never fire-and-forget for state-changing
calls**"*, inbound *"**requests** do not mutate directly"*, and *"two concurrent
peer **requests** must never mutate the same turn state"*. So: **each peer
operation is one request whose caller awaits exactly one operation-specific
result, or a typed transport/protocol failure.** No independent asynchronous
response message exists merely because the implementation is `async`, and an
operation result is **never** a peer-message semantic family. **PROJECT-CONTRACT**,
consistent with the committed concurrency model; the book specifies no transport.

**O2 — An operation's success result is not a failure channel.** A successful
operation-specific result is semantically distinct from transport failure,
parse/schema failure, authentication failure and protocol phase/order/cursor
failure. Each failure is raised by the layer that owns it and keeps its existing
error identity — `E-TRANSPORT`, `E-PROTO-MALFORMED`, `E-AUTH-FAILURE`,
`E-PROTO-STALE` — reinforced by the Gatekeeper rule that retries cover
*"transport-class errors only; never integrity errors"*. **No generic `accepted`
flag spanning layers may be introduced**, and a lower-layer failure must never be
encoded as a semantic `False` (nor semantic rejection as a transport failure).

**O3 — Logical operations, with the reference names as compatibility aliases.**
`PRD02-FR-033` already enumerates the semantic operations the runtime needs;
`PRD02-FR-034` marks the four reference tool names **REFERENCE-COMPATIBILITY
DEFAULT — NOT BOOK-MANDATED**. R11 keeps exactly that split and adds only the
routing:

| Logical operation (PRD02-FR-033) | Carries | Compatibility alias (PRD02-FR-034) |
|---|---|---|
| (a) Step-0 declaration + auth envelope | Step-0 family *(payload blocked)* | `negotiate` |
| (b) exchange / lock config | Config negotiation, Config lock *(payloads blocked)* | `negotiate` |
| (c)(d)(e) commitment · acknowledgement · reveal | `Commitment`, `Acknowledgement`, `Reveal` | `receive_turn` |
| (f) exchange final-audit material | `FinalNonceReveal`, then the audit material *(representation blocked)* | `submit_audit` |
| (g) exchange result approval | `ResultAgreement` *(payload frozen 4E-R13/R13-R1; carries the sender's `ResultContribution`, returns the receiver's `Sha256Digest`)* | `receive_control` |
| (h) optional control / heartbeat | — | `receive_control` |

The **internal** semantic architecture depends on the logical operation identity,
never on a tool-name string. Routing a family to an operation does **not** define
that family's payload, and the four blocked families stay blocked. **No fifth
validation operation exists** — the move-rejection outcome is a *result* of
(c)(d)(e), not an operation of its own.

**O4 — Stable ingress, local role routing.** One stable group-level ingress
endpoint per team for the series (declaration rule, NET-001), carrying no secret.
Behind it, `SeriesLauncher` may dispatch to the role-specific local backend for
the current sub-game. `SeriesLauncher` remains **operational routing only** —
never a referee, never shared truth, never shared game state (PRD02-FR-010,
PRD02-AC-018). **No separate public Police/Thief URLs** for alternating roles, and
the declaration is never silently mutated when the local role backend changes.

**O5 — Turn outcome of the operation carrying a Reveal** *(amended at Stage
5-R8; supersedes the legality-`bool` form of C-12, see **C-13**)*. The operation
carrying a **Reveal** returns exactly one **`TurnOutcome`**:

- **`accepted: bool`** — whether the reveal is acceptable on the facts the
  receiver can actually check: a well-formed action from a role permitted to
  take it, and for a `BarrierAction` a target that is on the board and not
  already blocked. It is **not** remote spatial legality. The mover's
  pre-action cell is sealed until the final audit, so bounds, blocked
  destinations and the resulting cell are **not knowable live** and are never
  asserted here.
- **`capture: CaptureAnswer`** — `NO_QUESTION`, `NOT_CAUGHT` or `CAUGHT`,
  computed by the receiver from its **own** `LocalTruth` and public facts. Same
  cell answers a `capture_claim`; a barrier answers by its own public target and
  by the trapped rule. No position is ever returned.

**Local legality is unchanged and still mandatory**: the sender validates its
own action in full through `domain.rules` / `LocalTurnService` **before**
committing, so an illegal action never produces an `H_commit` and never leaves.

**Hidden-state-dependent legality is a final-audit responsibility.** From the
disclosed sealed record the verifier reconstructs the mover's pre-action cell
and proves or disproves the action and any capture declaration. *(Implemented
at the Stage 5-R8 semantic-audit checkpoint: `app.semantic_review` replays the
sub-game from the two disclosed logs — see **C-13** and **JDEC-016**.)*

It never means network delivered, JSON parsed, signature valid, sender valid,
phase valid, cursor valid, commitment valid or reveal-hash valid — those
failures are raised by O2's owning layers and **never reach this result**.
Exactly one result per invocation that reaches this layer. Correlation is the
awaited invocation itself, so **no `TurnCursor` echo** and no duplication of
`action`, `hint`, `nonce`, `digest` or `state`. **No free text crosses the
boundary.** This is **PROJECT-CONTRACT** (C-12 as amended by C-13); the source
requires the capture resolution and the rejection, not this exact shape.

**O6 payload gained one member at Stage 5-R8**: the audit-disclosure document
carries `capture[]` — `{step, claim, answer}` rows for the reveals this side
made — beside `entries[]`. Still one schema, one operation, no new tool: the
transcript is part of the same document the peer already parses, and the
receiver refuses a document that omits it (`LOG_CONTRACT.md`).

**O6 — Audit-material submission operation.** Operation (f), alias `submit_audit`
— **PROJECT-CONTRACT / REFERENCE-COMPATIBILITY, not book-mandated**. Cadence is
**one submission per completed sub-game**, following the existing per-sub-game log
artifact ownership (`log_<game_id>_g<NN>.json`); whole-series batching is *not*
assumed. Producer `infra.logger` (finalized material), storage `infra.artifacts`,
transport `PeerTransportPort`/`PeerServerPort`, consumer the replay/audit
verifier which persists what it receives. **No `FinalAuditVerdict`, expected
digest, recomputed digest or TAMPERED reason is transmitted, and no audit
verdict ACK is invented** — successful submission is represented by ordinary
operation completion, failure by the owning typed failure, so the operation needs
**no additional semantic result**. **No second audit schema** (`AuditEntry`,
`AuditBundle`, `AuditEvidenceMessage`) is created. **The payload representation was
frozen at Stage 4E-R11-R1**: the operation carries the exact **JSON-native
audit-disclosure document** — dict/list/str/int/bool material as `LOG_CONTRACT.md`
freezes it — and **never** a filesystem path, artifact URL, base64, pickle, raw
bytes or Python object. Whole-log byte identity between peers is **not** required
(semantic equality of the disclosure core is), and no log-level hash exists. The
verdict and the other locally-derived annotations are **not** transmitted; the
receiver recomputes them. Both former integration blockers are now resolved in
`INTEROPERABILITY_BLOCKERS.md`.

**O7 — Binding boundary.** An operation contract is not a FastMCP binding. R11
defines logical operations and their semantic request/result contracts; a later
implementation stage maps them to FastMCP tools. No decorator, signature or JSON
schema is defined here, and `PRD02-FR-035` still governs concrete signatures.

- **P2b — Four acceptances stay distinct** *(Stage 4E-R10-R3, C-12)*. A received turn passes
  through **delivery/parsing** (`PeerServerPort`), **authentication** (`KeyedAuthPort` where
  applicable), **protocol phase/cursor/order** (`app.state_machine`) and finally **game legality**
  (`GameRulesPort` → `domain.rules`). Appendix E #14's "rejection of a move by the opponent"
  concerns **only the last**, and its peer-facing outcome is a transport/port **response**, not a
  peer-message family. These must never collapse into one `accepted` flag — the reference FastMCP
  `receive_move` returns `{"accepted": is_valid, …}` where `is_valid = verify_signature(...)`,
  which is the *authentication* acceptance and is **not** a legality verdict. The exact response
  shape is deferred with every other concrete signature to Stage 2B-2C and is tracked as
  `MOVE-REJECTION-TRANSPORT-SHAPE` in `INTEROPERABILITY_BLOCKERS.md`. Transport never re-derives
  legality, applies a move, mutates `LocalTruth`, computes scoring or chooses technical loss.
- **P3 — Non-determinism is isolated.** Only `PeerTransportPort`, `PeerServerPort`,
  `ClockPort`, `ReportPort`, `LlmAdvisorPort` are non-deterministic; all are injected so
  tests can substitute deterministic fakes.
- **P4 — Ingress is untrusted.** `PeerServerPort` validates schema, ordering, identity,
  and freshness before anything reaches `app`.
- **P5 — Replay is offline-capable.** `ReplayPort` takes file paths and needs no network,
  no clock, and no live state.
- **P6 — Egress cannot mutate.** `ReportPort` has no write path back into domain/app.
- **P8 — Profiles are read-only at match time.** `CompatibilityProfilePort` is resolved
  during negotiation and frozen with the config lock; it can never be switched mid-series.
- **P9 — `KeyedAuthPort` is profile-driven.** It implements `AuthProfile ∈ {HMAC_SHA256
  (default), ED25519 (attachment-compatibility)}`. **Plain unkeyed SHA-256 is not a valid
  Step-0 producer-authentication profile.**
- **P7 — Ports are stable, adapters are not.** Swapping FastMCP transport or LLM provider
  must not change any port contract.

## Signature-freeze policy (Stage 4D-R1)

This table is **architecture-level**: it fixes each port's caller, owner, semantic
operands, failure contract, sync/async mode and trust class. It fixes **no Python
signature**, and no other frozen document supplies one — a repository-wide search of
`docs/architecture/` and `docs/prd/` finds no `def`, no `Protocol` and no return
annotation. That is a deliberate deferral, not an omission.

Consequences, recorded so no later stage mistakes one for the other:

- **Any Python method name, parameter list or return type chosen later is a
  PROJECT-CONTRACT**, decided by this project — never `SOURCE-MANDATED`,
  `LECTURER-EXACT` or `REFERENCE-EXACT`. It must be recorded as such when frozen.
- The reference-compatible FastMCP tool names `negotiate`, `receive_turn`,
  `submit_audit`, `receive_control` are **LECTURER_REFERENCE_COMPATIBILITY** only
  (PRD02-FR-034 labels them a MAY). They are adapter-surface names and must never
  become `app.ports` method names.
- A port row is **not** an instruction to create a Python `Protocol` immediately. A
  row whose implementation owner is a pure, deterministic, in-process `domain`
  service that `app` may already call directly (`ScoringPort`, `GameRulesPort`,
  `BeliefPort`) documents the call boundary; wrapping it in a Protocol adds
  indirection without substitutability. Injection is required for the
  non-deterministic ports named in **P3**.
- **`StrategyPort` is wired into production at Stage 6C-B.** `AgentComposition`
  carries one, typed as the port, and `compose_agent` constructs the repository's
  `BaselineStrategy` directly - no dotted-path loader, because App F Table 22 is
  *"a reference table only"* and there is one strategy to choose between. The
  register is **still 21**: the row was already there.
- **`StrategyPort` gained a Python `Protocol` at Stage 6B** (`app.strategy_api`),
  and the register is **still 21** — an existing row acquiring a callable form is
  not a new port identity. It is also the one row this section's rule *positively*
  justifies wrapping: a `Protocol` earns its indirection when implementations are
  genuinely interchangeable, which is exactly what a baseline that must later be
  replaced by a competitive policy means. `BeliefPort`, `ScoringPort` and
  `GameRulesPort` remain correctly unwrapped. The Stage-6B signature is
  `choose_action(observation: Observation) -> PhysicalAction`; the row's
  `ProposedAction` (with hint/intent/confidence) is **reserved for PRD-04**,
  which owns the language half of a turn.
- **21 ports** are registered here: the original 18, plus `SeriesLauncherPort`
  and `CompatibilityProfilePort` at Stage 2A-R2, plus `NonceSourcePort` at Stage
  5-R4P. The last is an authorized architecture evolution rather than a new
  source requirement: `NonceValue` is representation-only by contract, so
  CSPRNG production (CRYPTO-010) needed a provider, and hiding that capability
  behind an unregistered callable would have kept the count honest while making
  the architecture less so.
- **Superseded for the four peer tools at Stage 4E-R17-R1** *(see below)*. The
  deferral above was correct while no transport existed; Stage 4E-R17 proved it
  had become the blocker — three semantic variants share `negotiate`, three share
  `receive_turn`, two share `submit_audit`, and nothing frozen told a receiver
  which had arrived. The binding is now fixed. Everything else in this section
  stands, including that the chosen names are **PROJECT-CONTRACT**.
- **`StrategyPort` reaches a whole series at Stage 6C-C1.** `series_driver.SeriesDriver`
  builds one `SubGameDriver` per sub-game and hands each the same composed strategy, so
  the port is called exactly once per own turn across all six sub-games. **The register
  stays 21** - the series driver introduces no port, and every collaborator it uses is an
  existing runtime owner.
- **The permanent CLI reaches the same port at Stage 6C-C2.** `AutonomousBoot`
  builds the one `SeriesDriver` a process runs, so a real `python -m …` process calls
  `StrategyPort` once per own turn for six sub-games. **The register stays 21**: boot
  adds no port, and `ArtifactStorePort` and `TokenAccountingPort` were already
  registered - it merely supplies their production implementations.

**O-note (Stage 4E-R12) — profile provisioning is not an operation.** No `O8` is
created and **O1-O7 are unchanged**. Two clarifications to the existing text:
`CompatibilityProfilePort` is listed above as accepting "negotiated profile ids
(`AuthProfile`, `CommitmentCodec`, `ResultProfile`)" — for `AuthProfile` and its
`KeyId` this is now read as **provisioned out of band before `BOOT`**, not
negotiated in band, because verifying the Step-0 `AuthProof` in
`STEP0_NEGOTIATION` cannot depend on a profile chosen by an unauthenticated
message (`SIGNATURE_AND_HASH_PROVENANCE.md` R12-A). The port's read-only-at-match-
time contract and its "unknown/weakening profile ⇒ refuse counted play" failure
contract are unchanged, and `KeyedAuthPort` still **never returns key material**
(**P2**). Operations **(a)** and **(b)** in O3 keep the `negotiate` compatibility
alias; R12 freezes what those operations *carry* — the Step-0 authenticated core
and envelope for (a), a complete `NegotiatedConfig` core plus the echo set and
then the four config-lock layers for (b) — without defining any FastMCP
signature, which stays deferred to Stage 2B-2C (**PRD02-FR-035**).

**O-note (Stage 4E-R13-R2) — the result-agreement operation.** **O1-O7 are
unchanged and no `O8` is created.** Operation **(g)** is one request → one awaited
response, exactly as O1 requires: the request is the **`ResultAgreement` semantic
value** (`game_id`, `game_uid`, `declaration_ref`, `timestamp`, `contribution`),
and the operation-specific successful response is a single **`Sha256Digest`** —
the receiver's locally computed `result_sha256`. Per **O1** an operation result is
never a peer-message semantic family, so the digest response is **not** a family
and **no ninth family exists**; per **O2** it is not a failure channel, and
transport, parse, authentication and protocol failures keep their own identities
(`E-TRANSPORT`, `E-PROTO-MALFORMED`, `E-AUTH-FAILURE`, `E-PROTO-STALE`) and never
reach it. The **deterministic proposer/non-proposer ordering** of the two calls is
**application-protocol semantics recorded in `RESULT_CONTRACT.md` §R13-R2** — it is
not transport magic, not a retry policy and not a race resolution; the transport
layer is unaware of it and merely delivers each request.

## Stage 4E-R17-R1 — the frozen peer-tool wire binding

`PRD02-FR-035` and **O7** deliberately deferred every concrete signature and JSON
schema to Stage 2B-2C. Stage 4E-R17 stopped `BLOCKED-BEFORE-CODE` on exactly that
gap: with the payload shape unfrozen, a conforming adapter could only have
dispatched by guessing which keys happened to be present, and two independent
implementations would have guessed differently. This section supplies the missing
binding. It is **PROJECT-CONTRACT** throughout — the book names no tools, no
envelope and no encoding — and it adds **no** requirement, error id, port, peer
family or `FIELD_MATRIX` row.

**Dependency.** The transport is **`fastmcp==3.4.6`** (exact pin, resolving
`mcp==1.29.0` and `pydantic==2.13.4`), over **Streamable HTTP**. STDIO is
permitted only for isolated framework probes and is never the counted-match
transport; SSE is not used. `PRD02-FR-037`'s "no FastMCP dependency at this
stage" described Stage 2; the dependency is authorized and pinned at Stage
4E-R17-R1.

### The request envelope

Every one of the four public tools takes **exactly one argument named
`request`**, whose JSON value is an object with **exactly two members**:

```
request = { "kind": <closed token>, "payload": { … } }
```

Both are **required**. No `type`, `message_type`, `msg_type`, `operation`, `op`,
`version`, `accepted`, `request_id`, `timestamp`, `sender` or `role` exists at
envelope level, and **no additional member is accepted** — the generated schema
carries `additionalProperties: false` at both levels and `required: ["kind",
"payload"]`, verified against the installed framework.

### The closed `kind` vocabulary, per tool

| Tool | `kind` | Decodes to |
|---|---|---|
| `negotiate` | `step0` | `Step0DeclarationExchange` |
| `negotiate` | `config_proposal` | `ConfigProposal` |
| `negotiate` | `config_lock` | `ConfigLockEvidence` |
| `receive_turn` | `commitment` | `Commitment` |
| `receive_turn` | `acknowledgement` | `Acknowledgement` |
| `receive_turn` | `reveal` | `Reveal` |
| `submit_audit` | `final_nonce_reveal` | `FinalNonceReveal` |
| `submit_audit` | `audit_disclosure` | the frozen JSON-native audit-disclosure core |
| `receive_control` | `result_agreement` | `ResultAgreement` |

Tokens are **lowercase ASCII, compared exactly** — no alias, no case folding, no
normalization, no whitespace trimming. An unknown token, a token sent to the
**wrong** tool, a missing member, a wrong-typed member or an extra member is
**`E-PROTO-MALFORMED`**; there is no cross-tool redispatch. **No heartbeat kind
exists**: `receive_control` carries `result_agreement` only, and no speculative
surface is added ahead of a requirement.

**The envelope is transport, not semantics.** It creates no peer family — the
inventory stays **8** — and `payload` carries the DTO of an already-frozen
semantic value. No `Step0Ack`, `ConfigAck`, `ConfigLockAck`, `ResultAck`,
`AuditAck`, `AuditBundle` or `MoveValidation` is introduced.

### Decimal on the wire

Every semantic `Decimal` crosses as **canonical decimal TEXT**: `Decimal("0.9")`
→ `"0.9"`, `Decimal("0.10")` → `"0.10"`. The receiver requires a JSON string,
validates it against the canonical decimal grammar, and constructs
`Decimal(text)` **directly**. JSON floats and integers, scientific notation,
whitespace, a leading `+` and locale separators are all **refused**, and there is
no rounding and no `Decimal(str(float))` path.

This is not caution about a hypothetical: measured against the installed stack, a
`Decimal`-annotated parameter given the JSON **number** `0.10` arrives as
`Decimal('0.1')` — a silent lexical loss that changes `config_sha256` and would
make two honest peers refuse each other. The same parameter given the JSON
**string** `"0.10"` arrives as `Decimal('0.10')`. Text is therefore the contract,
and the direct-`Decimal` path is deliberately not relied upon.

**The semantic and canonical layers are unchanged.** `CONFIG_CONTRACT.md` still
types these members `Decimal`, the canonical config bytes still carry the bare
JSON number `0.10`, and `FIELD_MATRIX.md` is untouched. Only the transport DTO
uses text.

### Success responses

| Kinds | Successful result |
|---|---|
| `step0`, `config_proposal`, `config_lock`, `commitment`, `acknowledgement`, `final_nonce_reveal`, `audit_disclosure` | **ordinary completion, no semantic value** — Python `None` |
| `reveal` | **`TurnOutcome`** — public acceptance + `CaptureAnswer` (**O5**, amended) |
| `result_agreement` | **`Sha256Digest`**, as exactly 64 lowercase hex characters, reconstructed client-side as `Sha256Digest(text)` |

Ordinary completion is **not** `accepted=true`, `ok=true`, `success=true` or an
ack family. Where the framework wraps a primitive result in its own
`structuredContent` object, that is a **framework envelope** and is never copied
into project semantics.

### Errors

A known application failure crosses the framework error channel carrying
**exactly its existing error identity** and nothing else — `E-PROTO-MALFORMED`,
`E-PROTO-STALE`, `E-AUTH-FAILURE`, `E-CONFIG-MISMATCH`, `E-REPORT-DISAGREE`,
`E-LOCAL-DEFECT`. **No Python exception text, no stack trace, no free-text
reason and no secret**; `key_id` remains the only key-related value that may
appear anywhere. The client adapter maps a known identity back to the local typed
failure; an unknown or malformed remote identity is `E-PROTO-MALFORMED`;
unreachable, HTTP failure and timeout stay with **`E-TRANSPORT`**. **No failure
is ever encoded as `False`** — that value belongs to `reveal` legality alone.

Verified against the installed framework: a `ToolError("E-PROTO-STALE")` is
observed client-side with `str(exception) == "E-PROTO-STALE"` **exactly**, with
no prefix or suffix, and the same identity is recoverable from the raw MCP error
content. **No error id was added: the inventory stays 20.**

## 8. External interoperability — the KIT profile

**Status: TRANSPORT IMPLEMENTED (Stage 8A-1T). A pinned-KIT peer can reach our
four tools and be understood. It cannot yet play us — see *What still blocks a
sparring series*.**

Several groups on this course use a shared interoperability kit
(`Imreec/copthief-league-protocol`), pinned here at
**`ad6557626587e09146af4283a5e808e7001343c5`**. It is **interoperability
guidance, not project source**: where the course book binds a rule, the book
wins, and the kit never overrides it.

### What is implemented

| Compact canonical JSON | `protocol/kit_canonical.py` |
| Commitment, **nonce outside** after a single `\|` | `protocol/kit_commitment.py` |

| Settlement consensus (**spaced** encoding) | `protocol/kit_consensus.py` |
| Codec / result dispatch | `protocol/commitment_codec.py`, `protocol/result_profile.py` |

### Two canonical authorities, on purpose

`protocol/canonical.py` serves the **strict project domain**: it refuses `None`
and binary `float` and carries decimals as exact text, because a float `0.10`
reaching a project hash changes `config_sha256` and makes two honest peers
refuse each other for a reason neither can see. `kit_canonical` serves the
JSON-native domain the kit actually uses. Where the domains overlap they emit
identical bytes; neither may drift into the other.

### Our sealed record is ours, not a universal schema

The eight-member sealed record is **strict/internal**. The kit is explicit that
payload key sets need not match across teams — each side seals its own record
and the opponent re-hashes what it revealed. Our outbound KIT payload is
deliberately *richer* than the kit minimum (step, sub-game, role, move, intent,
hint, position, barriers) because we already hold that evidence; we require
none of it back.

### Cryptographic proof is not semantic proof

Two gates. **Gate 1** recomputes the digest and interprets nothing — a
faithfully sealed illegal move passes it. **Gate 2** weighs semantic evidence
with four answers:

- `VERIFIED` — evidence exists and the check passed
- `FAILED` — evidence exists and proves a violation
- `NOT_APPLICABLE` — the check does not apply
- `NOT_CHECKABLE` — it applies, but this lawful profile cannot decide it

**Missing evidence is not tampering**, and **an undecidable binding check is not
clean**. What a gap costs depends on provenance: the book's gameplay rules
block a counted result when unsettled; our own enrichments (JDEC-018 scent
truthfulness, which needs a disclosed trajectory a KIT peer never promised) do
not. Blocking and violations are reported separately so a gap in what we can
prove is never printed as an accusation.

Role, sub-game and configuration come from the authenticated session, the
witnessed cursor and the verified lock — a payload carrying them is
cross-checked, one omitting them has withheld nothing. Intent is read only as
one of its two sealed words and is never inferred from hint language.

### Authentication is unchanged

The kit's `terms_signature` is an **unkeyed content-agreement digest** — anyone
holding the terms and nonce recomputes it. It proves both sides read the same
values and nothing about who is speaking. `AuthProfile.HMAC_SHA256` Step-0
authentication remains separately mandatory and nothing substitutes for it.

### The scent family is deliberately undeclared

The kit registers `multiplicative_book_v1` beside its own
`subtractive_chebyshev_v1` (which we refuse — our physics is App F T16 FIXED,
C-10, JDEC-018). Measured against our production physics at the pinned SHA:
kernel identical across all 25 weights, parameters identical, update rule,
cadence, order and clamp identical, both emit vectors and both scalar traces
exact. But **29 of 90 published field-walk cells differ** — replicating the
kit's own recurrence in binary floats reproduces its vectors exactly, so every
difference is one ULP of IEEE-754 accumulation against our exact `Decimal`.

Classification: **`MODEL_FORM_MATCH` + `NUMERIC_VECTOR_MISMATCH`**, not
vector-exact. No family hash is published on that basis.

### The transport surface, and how it is selected

The pinned wire is `vectors/turn_message.json` at `ad65576`, status **PROMOTED**:
de-facto interoperability practice between independently written peers, **not
book law**. Where the book binds a rule the book wins.

Four public tool names, and one argument each — the asymmetry is the kit's and
it is load-bearing:

| Tool | Argument | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `negotiate` | `message` | flat signed `terms` + `nonce` + `signature` + `group_id`, with pairing and locked-model declarations **beside** the terms |
| `receive_turn` | `message` | `step`, `sender`, `hint`, `smell_grid`, `commit`, `timestamp` (all required) plus four optional members |
| `submit_audit` | **`payload`** | `sender`, `records` (payload + nonce + commit), `result_claim` |
| `receive_control` | `message` | `kind` ∈ {enable, status, restart, quit}, `sender` |

A missing required key is **refused, never defaulted** — a defaulted commit is a
move the sender never sealed. An unknown key **inside** a message is tolerated
and ignored: that is the kit's declared extension seam, and it reaches no
semantic value, so it can mutate nothing.

**Two surfaces, and a process registers exactly one.** `ExternalMode` is chosen
out of band — `python -m mars777_thief --external-mode KIT_CORE_V1` — before the
server is registered and before the client exists. There is no auto-detection,
no key sniffing, no "try strict then KIT", and no downgrade after a failure:
each of those would turn an integrity failure into a silent compatibility story.
The same selection drives the outbound arguments, so a process cannot serve one
wire and speak the other.

Our published schemas were compared mechanically against the pinned peer's own,
read out of a running pinned server on its own FastMCP major (2.14.7). Tool
names, argument names, requiredness and the free-form message object are
identical. The one difference is at the *tool argument* level: our
`strict_input_validation` closes the argument object, so an unknown second
argument is refused rather than ignored. The kit's extension seam is one level
down, inside the message, and stays open.

### What a KIT turn is not

A KIT turn carries the sealed `commit` **and** the unsealed adjuncts in one
message, and never the action — under that wire the action is disclosed only in
`submit_audit`. So the commitment half maps exactly onto our `Commitment` and is
delivered to the unchanged `on_commitment`; the adjuncts are held beside it.
**No `Reveal` is invented**, and no second state machine exists: our own
commit → acknowledge → reveal cadence has no counterpart on this wire.

The smell grid is retained as the peer's binary64, unconverted. Our physics is
exact `Decimal`, and converting the peer's cells would assert an equivalence
that is `MODEL_FORM_MATCH` and **not** vector-exact.

### What still blocks a sparring series

Measured on 2026-08-18 against the pinned sparring peer (`serve --peer … --role
police`) running in an isolated venv, with our KIT ingress serving the
production `InboundPeerOperations`:

* the kit's own `doctor` classifies our ingress **PEER LISTENING**;
* the kit's real greeting — its terms, its signature, its four lock
  declarations — is **accepted**, `{"ok": true}`;
* `receive_turn` and `submit_audit` are **refused with `E-AUTH-FAILURE`**;
* `receive_control` is accepted and settles nothing;
* the series ends `SPAR-N09` — our counterpart never greeted back.

Two distinct blockers, and neither is a transport fault:

1. **Auth profile.** `AuthProfile.HMAC_SHA256` Step-0 stays mandatory. The
   pinned `negotiate` has no place for a keyed proof and its receiver drops
   unknown keys, so a pinned peer can neither send one nor read ours. It was
   **not bypassed** to make sparring green.
2. **Role and turn orchestration.** Nothing drives our KIT outbound side yet:
   `send_kit` exists and is proved over real HTTP, but no runtime decides when
   to greet, when to take a turn, or how roles alternate. That is Stage 8A-2.

### What is still missing

Role alternation, the public-ingress integration, and a counted series.
`FIXED_ROLE` remains our only executable role convention — alternation is a
**pre-match convention and a de-facto pairing practice, not a book requirement**
— and the pinned harness's `--role police|thief` shows fixed-role sparring is
supported by it, so the gap is ours and is orchestration, not wire.

Nothing about a sparring run is counted. League diversity evidence still
requires a real, independently authored, enrolled group.
