# Concurrency Model — group MaRs-777

**Status: STAGE 2A ARCHITECTURE FREEZE — design only.**

**Guiding rule: the game is deterministic and single-threaded; only I/O is
concurrent.** Simplicity is a correctness feature here — a race that corrupts turn
state is indistinguishable from cheating and can void a match.

## 1. Model

```
   async I/O edge (FastMCP server, client, timers)
                │  events enqueued
                ▼
        ┌────────────────────────┐
        │  single Turn Executor  │   ← serializes ALL state-changing work
        │  (one logical thread)  │
        └────────────────────────┘
                │ applies
                ▼
        state machine + domain (never touched concurrently)
```

- **One asyncio event loop.** No threads for game logic; no multiprocessing.
- **The domain and state machine are never entered concurrently.** All mutation happens
  inside the Turn Executor's serialized critical section.
- **Inbound requests do not mutate directly.** The MCP server validates, converts to an
  event, and submits it to the executor queue.

## 2. The concurrency rule that matters most

> **Two concurrent peer requests must never mutate the same turn state.**

Enforced by three layers:

1. **Serialization** — a single executor with an ordered queue; one event is processed
   to completion (including evidence write) before the next begins.
2. **Turn cursor + admissibility guard** — a turn-scoped inbound message carries
   `(sub_game, step)`, which identifies the turn; the executor accepts it **only** if that
   cursor matches the expected one **and** the message family is admissible in the
   receiver's current `ProtocolMachine` state. Anything else is `E-PROTO-STALE`
   (duplicate/replayed/out-of-order) and is rejected, not queued. Phase is **not** a
   transmitted cursor field — the receiver already owns the one authoritative phase
   (Stage 4E-R1-FIX1; previously this read "every inbound message carries
   `(sub_game, step, phase)`"). Control and finalization messages carry their own
   semantic identity instead of a turn cursor.
3. **Idempotency** — re-delivery of an already-applied step is answered from the
   recorded result; it never re-applies an effect (`STATE_MACHINE.md` R8).

Consequence: concurrency cannot reorder game history, and a hostile peer cannot induce
a double-apply by flooding.

## 3. Component lifecycles

| Component | Lifecycle | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **FastMCP server** | started at BOOT, stopped at shutdown | Bound locally; exposed via tunnel; readiness is a BOOT gate |
| **Outgoing peer calls** | per request, `async`, bounded | Always through Gatekeeper; never fire-and-forget for state-changing calls |
| **State machine** | one instance per process | Entered only from the executor |
| **Watchdog** | one timer per active step | Escalates: soft (`response_timeout_sec`) → hard (`watchdog_timeout_sec`). **Appendix F defaults 30 s / 60 s, status NEGOTIABLE** — the values actually used are read from the **locked negotiated config**, never hard-coded |
| **Deadline timers** | per step / per outbound call | Cancelled on completion; expiry becomes an executor event |
| **Retries** | Gatekeeper-owned | Transport-class errors only; never integrity errors |
| **Token bucket** | process-wide | `tokens←min(C, tokens + r·Δt)`; send iff `tokens ≥ 1` (NET-002) |
| **Queue depth** | bounded (App F T19 default 100 MINIMUM) | Overflow ⇒ reject with backpressure, never unbounded growth |
| **GUI channel** | subscribe-only async queue | **Lossy by design** — dropping a frame must never block or alter the game |
| **Graceful shutdown** | drain → seal evidence → stop server | Never abandon a half-written artifact |

## 4. Rate limiting and backoff

- Token-bucket limiter on **outgoing** calls (default 30 rpm MINIMUM).
- Concurrency cap (default 2 MINIMUM) on simultaneous outbound requests.
- Retry with backoff (default 5s MINIMUM, max_retries 3 MINIMUM).
- **HTTP 429 ⇒ back off and wait for the next window**, never immediate retry
  (REPORT-003/NET-002) — blind retry risks account suspension.
- Retry budget exhaustion ⇒ `E-RETRY-EXHAUSTED`, escalate per `ERROR_MODEL.md`.

## 5. Determinism guarantees

- Given the same seed, the same `Observation` sequence and the same injected clock, the
  **strategy decisions are reproducible**.
- Non-determinism is confined to `PeerTransportPort`, `PeerServerPort`, `ClockPort`,
  `ReportPort`, `LlmAdvisorPort` — all injected and fakeable.
- Replay never depends on timing: it reads sealed artifacts and recomputes hashes.

## 6. Known limitation — native-Windows two-process blackout

**Status: open, investigation closed, no workaround adopted (Stage 6C-C2-FINAL).**

The full six-sub-game series runs end to end on Ubuntu and WSL, as two real OS
processes, writing all fourteen official files and exiting 0. On **native
Windows** the same pair reproducibly stalls at the `g01` step-22 acknowledgement
and neither side finishes.

**Where the numbers come from.** The instrumented root-cause investigation was
carried out once, on this project's other role agent, which runs the same
pinned FastMCP / MCP / AnyIO / httpx stack and the same transport design. Those
measurements are quoted here because the limitation is a property of that shared
stack, not of a role; they were **not** re-measured in this repository, and no
diagnostic instrumentation was ported here. What this repository observes on its
own is the stall itself, at the same cursor.

Measured twice, at two different negotiated response deadlines:

| Locked `response_timeout_sec` | Peer POST held | Opponent heartbeat blackout |
|---|---|---|
| 30 | 30.375 s | 30.375 s |
| 45 | 45.391 s | 45.593 s |

The request body arrives promptly and completely; the receiving side's event
loop then makes no progress until the *caller's* deadline expires, and resumes
at that moment. **The blackout is released by peer cancellation, so raising the
deadline lengthens the stall rather than surviving it.** The negotiated default
therefore stays at Appendix F's 30 s, no retry was added, and no gameplay,
protocol or configuration workaround was adopted.

Scope and honesty about what this is:

- It is **not** a Proactor-specific scheduling defect. A controlled experiment
  reproduced essentially the same stall with the synthetic opponent running
  `_WindowsSelectorEventLoop` while the agent under test stayed on
  `ProactorEventLoop`, so it reproduces under **both** tested Windows
  event-loop policies.
- It is best described as a **Windows-native two-process event-loop blackout /
  mutual peer-request deadlock in the current FastMCP / MCP / AnyIO execution
  path**. The exact internal third-party or runtime primitive responsible
  **remains unresolved**, and nothing here is a proven upstream bug in FastMCP,
  MCP, AnyIO, asyncio or Windows.
- `g01` step 22 is the **observed integration seam** where it surfaces, not a
  protocol-mandated failing cursor.
- The counterparty is the synthetic, non-counted integration opponent. This
  limitation says nothing about counted interoperability, which still requires
  another group's agent.

Two real timeout-authority defects were found and fixed while investigating it
(`PeerDeadline` binding the locked config, and a held session refreshing its
read deadline after the lock). Both are correct on their own merits and are
kept; **neither solves this stall.**

CI keeps it visible rather than hidden: the Windows gating job runs the whole
suite except this one test, and a separate non-gating job
*Windows native exact-six known limitation* runs exactly that test in full view.
The test is not deleted and not `xfail`ed, and on Linux it remains fully gating.

If a future dependency upgrade eliminates it, revalidate then; no work is
scheduled around it now.

## 7. Forbidden concurrency patterns

- Mutating domain state from an I/O callback.
- Two executors, or a background task that writes game state.
- Locks around domain objects as a substitute for the single-executor design.
- Blocking the event loop with synchronous network/LLM calls.
- Letting GUI backpressure stall the game loop.
- Unbounded queues or unbounded retry loops.
