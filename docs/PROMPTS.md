# Prompt Register - group MaRs-777

> **Status: CURRENT.** Backfilled through Stage 9A-1B2.
> **Purpose:** The prompt-engineering log. It records the supervising-reviewer
> prompts that drove each stage — their goal, their binding constraints, what
> the AI got wrong, what the human correction was, and what shipped.
> **Honesty rule:** nothing here is a reconstructed transcript. Rows in section 1
> are labelled `Referenced` — the prompt existed and drove the named stage, and
> its text is not reproduced. Entries in section 2 are labelled
> **`RECONSTRUCTED PROMPT INTENT`**: they summarise the goal and constraints
> from evidence that exists in this repository (`docs/PLAN.md`,
> `docs/TODO.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md`, the commit
> history). Where the exact wording is not available it is **not invented**.
> **Note:** Never store secrets, tokens, or credentials here.

## 2. Prompt engineering log (Stages 5 — 9A-1B2)

Every entry below is **`RECONSTRUCTED PROMPT INTENT`**, not verbatim prompt text.

### Stage 5 (5-R1 … 5-R8) — production application runtime integration

- **Goal.** Turn the assembled protocol parts into a production runtime, then
  give the scent system a pre-game contract: a canonical model, its digest, and
  agreement on it before a game starts.
- **Constraints.** No second configuration schema. Exact model agreement — no
  tolerance, no "close enough" float comparison. The scent model must be inside
  what the configuration lock covers, or locking is theatre.
- **Finding.** Canonical decimal text had to become a single shared authority;
  two independent renderings of the same number are two different sealed bytes.
- **Correction.** The decimal authority was extracted and shared rather than
  duplicated at each call site.
- **Result.** Scent model defined, carried in proposals, agreed exactly, bound
  into the config lock, frozen across the series, persisted as artifact
  evidence, and traced closed against `SCENT-001`/`SCENT-003` (C-14, JDEC-018).

### Stage 6A / 6B — baseline strategy

- **Goal.** A separate strategy module that chooses a legal action.
- **Constraints.** Fully algorithmic. No LLM. No randomness. **No opponent
  position** — it is not observable, and a strategy that reads it would be
  cheating even if it were.
- **Correction.** 6A was held to contract and design only; no code was written
  until the contract was locked.
- **Result.** `BaselineStrategy` behind `StrategyPort`, deterministic, covered.

### Stage 6C-A / 6C-B / 6C-C1 — autonomous game owner, sub-game, series

- **Goal.** Something that actually plays: one lockstep sub-game, then exactly
  six.
- **Constraints.** No fixture may supply an action, an outcome, or a lifecycle
  call. The terminal event must be **derived** from the domain, never asserted.
- **Result.** `SubGameDriver`, then `SeriesDriver` producing `g01`…`g06`, six
  natural outcomes and the fourteen official files.

### Stage 6C-C2 — permanent autonomous CLI boot

- **Goal.** A real process that boots, plays and exits.
- **Constraint.** Prove it as **separate OS processes**, not in-process.
- **Finding — the most valuable of the project.** The in-process proof had
  hidden three real defects: (1) `SeriesDriver.open()` re-opened the round it
  was already on, destroying an authenticated proposal that had arrived first;
  (2) closing a sub-game did not wait for the **peer's** audit disclosure;
  (3) the peer's Step-0 had no awaitable moment at all.
- **Correction.** Each was fixed at its owner. None was fixed by weakening a
  guard or by loosening a test.
- **Result.** Both roles' shipped CLIs play a full series over real FastMCP/HTTP
  against a separate process and exit 0.

### Windows exact-six investigation

- **Goal.** Find out why a native Windows run stalled.
- **Constraint.** Do not "fix" it with a skip.
- **Finding.** After a long trace through the event loop, the HTTP request-body
  path and the MCP session handoff, the root cause was a session read deadline
  that was not refreshed after the configuration lock.
- **Result.** Fixed at its owner; the residual native limitation runs in its own
  CI job so it stays visible instead of disappearing behind a skip.

### Stage 7B — deterministic hint channel

- **Goal.** The natural-language half of a turn, at the T0 (no-model) scope.
- **Constraints.** Zero tokens, no network, no model. Refuse direct coordinate
  syntax such as `(3,4)` — **while leaving ordinary numeric prose sayable**, so
  the filter cannot be satisfied by banning digits.
- **Result.** A template catalogue, an NFC-normalising validator with
  deterministic word counting against the negotiated cap, and a narrow detector.
  A failing candidate is replaced by a safe template, never sent in violation.

### Stage 7C — belief-level scent interpretation

- **Goal.** Let the strategy use what the opponent disclosed.
- **Constraint.** Scent is evidence about the **environment**, never the
  opponent's position, and it may only decide where the existing objective ties.
  With nothing heard, behaviour must be byte-identical to before.
- **Result.** `ScentBelief`, folded through the existing physics under the
  locked model.

### Stage 7D-B — competitive barrier policy

- **Goal.** A legal competitive edge.
- **Constraints.** Promote on measured evidence or not at all. Never declare a
  capture on belief — a missed barrier costs a turn, a wrong claim forfeits.
- **Finding.** The police candidate cleared its gate (0 → 12 captures over 140
  deterministic scenarios). The **thief candidate failed its gate.**
- **Correction.** The thief candidate was **rejected and not shipped**; that
  repository still runs the frozen baseline. Recording the rejection is the
  point.

### Stage 8A-1R / 8A-1S — interoperability kit core

- **Goal.** Speak the pinned third party's semantics without vendoring or
  patching their code.
- **Constraints.** Pinned SHA only. Never copy their artifacts into either
  repository.
- **Finding.** Their scent family could not be declared compatible: the model
  form matches exactly, but 29 of 90 published field-walk cells differ by one
  ULP — binary64 against our exact `Decimal`.
- **Correction.** Declared **undeclared** rather than approximately compatible.

### Stage 8A-1T — kit transport envelopes

- **Goal.** A second envelope profile over the same four tools.
- **Constraints.** Selected **before boot**; never negotiated, never inferred
  from a message, never auto-downgraded. Do not weaken authentication.
- **AI mistake (significant).** The stage report claimed the pinned harness
  could run a six-sub-game series with **fixed roles**. It cannot.
- **Result.** The profile shipped; the false claim survived into the next stage
  and was caught there.

### Stage 8A-2 — fixed-role kit series — **STOPPED**

- **Goal.** Run a six-sub-game fixed-role series against the kit.
- **Constraint given.** "If full gameplay is blocked by a **new** issue: stop and
  name the exact blocker. Do not add another workaround in the same checkpoint."
- **Finding.** The premise was false. The harness alternates roles every
  sub-game by construction.
- **Correction.** The stage stopped with **zero repository changes**, and the
  previous stage's incorrect claim was retracted explicitly rather than quietly
  worked around.

### Stage 8A-2R — role-split alternation and terminal settlement

- **Goal.** Play the alternating series for real.
- **Constraints.** Neither repository may become a dual-role agent. No importing
  the sibling package, no copying its strategy, no changing `GROUP_CODE`.
- **Finding.** A live divergence: we settled `CAPTURE`, the peer settled
  `timeout`. The tempting explanation — a missing terminal message — was only
  half of it.
- **Correction.** The real root cause was ours: the self-capture rule was being
  applied to the **police**, although `BAR-004` lets the police place a barrier
  on its own cell and lawfully stand on a blocked one. A lawful placement was
  manufacturing a capture. Fixed at the rule **and** the missing settlement
  signal.
- **Result.** Six live sub-games against an independent implementation.

### Stage 8A-2F — development evidence path

- **Goal.** Persist evidence from a friendly run without pretending it is
  counted.
- **Constraints.** "Do not lie to preserve a filename." "The number 14 is **not**
  more important than semantic truth." No secret, no live URL, no stale endpoint
  in any artifact.
- **Result.** A store that **structurally refuses** any name not beginning
  `friendly_`, and a series document that records `ABSENT` for counted
  authentication and mutual agreement, `evidence_class:
  DEVELOPMENT_EVIDENCE`, `counted_eligible: false`.

### Stage 8A-2G — counted identity and artifact compatibility

- **Goal.** Make the kit's `game_id` writable without corrupting our identity.
- **Constraint.** "Do not silently lower-case the group id. Do not alter
  `GROUP_CODE`."
- **Finding.** Our own identifier alphabet (JDEC-005) rejected the kit-derived
  id because `MaRs-777` contains capitals.
- **Correction.** The **project-owned** decision was amended to admit the wider
  alphabet — the frozen group code was not bent to fit a project rule.

### Stage 8A-2G-CI — exact-SHA CI recovery

- **Goal.** Get green CI on the exact commits.
- **Constraint.** "No code change is authorized." No empty commit, no amend, no
  force, no tag, no whitespace push to trigger a run.
- **Finding.** The three-second failures were **not** a code failure: GitHub had
  blocked the account for a billing reason.
- **Result.** Existing runs re-run by id once billing was fixed. Both SHAs green,
  history untouched.

### Stage 8B-P — public production readiness without a partner

- **Goal.** Wire the gateway and the tunnel adapter — both previously uncalled
  from production — behind one public route.
- **Constraints.** Report credentials as `PRESENT`/`ABSENT` only, never their
  contents. Do not commit live URLs or runtime evidence. Do not start the tunnel
  prematurely.
- **Finding.** The framework-confinement test refused the new launcher's FastMCP
  imports.
- **Correction.** The allowlist was **deliberately not widened**; the mechanics
  moved into the transport package instead, where framework imports belong.
- **Result.** One public route, a ten-check readiness gate, proven teardown, and
  the counted-readiness authority still correctly refusing while the tunnel was
  up.

### Stage 9A-0 — academic excellence gap audit

- **Goal.** Audit the repositories against the book, the professional-software
  guideline and their own contracts, and produce a gap matrix.
- **Constraints.** Read-only. No code, no strategy, no tag. Do not authorise the
  closure slices; return them for approval.
- **Finding.** The largest gaps were deliverable coverage (Replay Viewer, GUI,
  reporting, rate-limit enforcement) and **document truth** — eight
  machine-detectable contradictions between the front-door documents and the
  committed state.
- **Result.** Zero repository changes; a supervising report.

### Stage 9A-1A — academic truth and guideline foundation closure

- **Goal.** Close the low-risk truth, documentation and hygiene defects, and
  perform the measurements the heavier slices depend on.
- **Constraints.** Use the lecturer's **actual** v3.00 PDF, verified by SHA-256,
  read-only, never committed. No production code. No SDK, no gatekeeper, no test
  split, no GUI, no replay, no Gmail, no strategy change, no tag.
- **AI mistake corrected by supervision (three).** (1) Stage 9A-0 proposed
  narrowing the published 150-line rule to `src/**`; the guideline's §6.1
  explicitly applies it to test files too, so the rule stands and the tests must
  be split. (2) 9A-0 counted **physical** lines and reported 29 violating test
  files; measured the guideline's way — blank and comment lines excluded — the
  true count is **13**. (3) 9A-0 treated the SDK requirement as satisfied by
  hexagonal architecture; §4.1 asks for an explicit single public entry
  boundary, which does not exist, so it is a mapped gap rather than a
  justified N/A.
- **Result.** Front-door documents reconciled with reality, the prompt book
  backfilled, `.env.example` and `docs/PRD.md` added,
  `docs/GUIDELINE_ALIGNMENT.md` written against the real guideline, and complete
  version-authority, SDK-equivalence and Gatekeeper-equivalence audits recorded.

### Stage 9A-1B1 — software version authority and public SDK facade

- **Goal.** Close the two guideline gaps the audit had mapped: one software
  version authority, and one public entry point for every consumer.
- **Constraints.** Resolve the guideline's version semantics from the PDF rather
  than guessing. The facade holds **zero** business logic. No test split, no
  gatekeeper, no Gmail, no replay, no GUI, no strategy change, no tag. Command
  line behaviour - flags, defaults, exit codes, error semantics, banner - must
  not change.
- **Finding (version).** The guideline's `1.00` is not a PEP-440-stable string:
  the packaging rules normalise it to `1.0`, so declaring `1.00` in
  `pyproject.toml` would publish metadata that disagrees with the declaration.
  Two truths, to satisfy formatting.
- **Correction.** The value is stored once as `MAJOR.MINOR` and *rendered* twice
  - `1.00` for the guideline, `1.0` for packaging. Nothing can drift, because
  neither string is stored.
- **Finding (boot validation).** §8.1's boot clause asks for **configuration**
  version compatibility, not software version compatibility. Reading it as a
  peer check would have coupled our package version to another group's
  implementation.
- **Correction.** The configuration half was mapped to the authority that
  already exists and is already covered by the mutual config digest; the
  software half became a **local** integrity check - installed distribution
  metadata against the source authority - that no peer can cause or observe.
- **Finding (facade).** Moving composition out of the command lines broke two
  boot guards that asserted "only the entrypoint declares the role" and "only
  the entrypoint reads the environment".
- **Correction.** The guarded property - *exactly one* place - was still true;
  the assertions were retargeted to follow it to `identity` and `compose_series`
  rather than deleted or weakened.
- **Result.** `shared/version.py`, `sdk/` with five forwarding operations, four
  composition modules below it, three command lines reduced to parse-request-
  classify, and structural tests holding both dependency directions.

### Stage 9A-1B1F — configuration version compatibility

- **Goal.** Close the one part of guideline §8.1 that the version stage had left
  `PARTIAL`: local support for the configuration schema version.
- **Constraints.** Do not add software-version comparison to the peer protocol.
  Do not change `config_sha256` bytes. Do not add a KIT wire field. Do not invent
  a rate-limit or artifact version. Resolve the supported token mechanically
  rather than from a historical report.
- **Finding (the distinction).** `NegotiatedConfig.schema_version` was validated
  non-empty, hashed and mutually agreed - and never checked against anything this
  build supports. Agreement is byte-identity between peers; compatibility is a
  local question about representation. Two peers could agree perfectly on a
  version neither of them supported.
- **Finding (the value).** No supported-version constant existed in `src/` at
  all: the token appeared only in test builders. It was resolved from the
  project's own contract instead - `VERSIONING.md` records JDEC-003 naming
  `mars777-1` and NDEC-004 making it a negotiated pre-match term because it sits
  inside the signed core.
- **Correction.** One authority, `SUPPORTED_CONFIG_SCHEMA_VERSIONS`, enforced at
  the single point where a configuration first becomes a value - the domain
  constructor - so no entry path can route around it and no layer duplicates it.
  `UnsupportedConfigSchemaError` subclasses the existing section error, so every
  caller that already classified configuration failures keeps working.
- **Finding (a fixture, not a defect).** A test fixture built "a different but
  valid config" by setting `schema_version` to `9.9.9`. That is no longer a
  representable value, so the fixture varies the board size instead - its intent
  preserved, and its failure was the first proof the authority works.
- **Result.** An unsupported revision is refused at the domain boundary and
  reported at the operator boundary as a local refusal naming the version. The
  frozen configuration digest vector is unchanged.

### Stage 9A-1B2 — test modularity and the 150-line gate

- **Goal.** Clear the known test-file size debt and make the rule enforceable
  instead of auditable.
- **Constraints.** Split by responsibility, never `part1`/`part2`. No production
  change of any kind. No test semantics lost - same assertions, same parameter
  sets, same marks, same skips. Docstrings **count** as code lines: a checker
  that excluded them would reward deleting documentation to pass a size gate.
- **Method, stated honestly.** The splits are a **refactor of existing tests**,
  so no RED was manufactured for moving code. The **checker** is new behaviour
  and was written RED-first: its rule tests (blank lines, comment-only lines,
  inline comments, docstrings, decorators, multi-line expressions, exactly 150,
  151) and its scanner tests (both trees, non-Python ignored, sorted output)
  all failed before it existed.
- **Finding.** The checker's own "this repository is clean" test was RED for the
  whole stage and only went green when the last file was split - which is the
  most useful test in the batch, because it is the one CI will run.
- **Finding.** Two helpers were shared across the new files and had to be
  extracted rather than duplicated (`drop`, `empty_chain`); both lost their
  leading underscore because they became imported names. Two module pairs would
  otherwise have imported each other, so their shared doubles moved into
  modules of their own instead.
- **Finding.** `r7_builders` had twenty-nine consumers. Rather than repoint all
  of them, the implementations were grouped into three modules by what they
  build and the original module became the family's explicit re-export surface -
  the same boundary pattern the production SDK uses.
- **Correction.** An automated import-linker bound a name called `play` to the
  wrong module - two helper modules defined that name. Caught by the suite, not
  by review, and fixed by importing from the module that actually owns it.
- **Result.** Police 13 and thief 12 over-limit files became zero; every original
  test function is present and mapped; production coverage totals are unchanged;
  the gate is now automatic on both operating systems.

## 3. Practices this project actually learned

1. **Prove it as a process.** Every in-process proof in this project hid at
   least one defect that a separate OS process exposed immediately.
2. **A stop is a result.** Stage 8A-2 delivered more value by stopping with zero
   changes than it would have by working around a false premise.
3. **Fix at the owner.** Every live divergence was traced to a rule or a state
   owner and fixed there — never at the symptom, never by loosening a guard.
4. **Never bend an identity to fit a rule you own.** Amend the rule you own;
   leave the frozen identity alone.
5. **Measure the way the standard defines the measure.** Counting physical lines
   against a code-line rule produced a wrong answer by more than a factor of two.
6. **Name what is absent.** `ABSENT`, `counted_eligible: false` and a rejected
   strategy candidate are all more useful than a tidy document.
7. **Read the standard's own words before satisfying it.** `1.00` looked like a
   literal to copy; it is a value to represent. Copying it would have created the
   drift the clause exists to prevent.
8. **When code moves, move the guard with it.** A structural test that fails
   because its subject moved is a test to retarget, never one to delete.
9. **Agreement is not compatibility.** Two parties holding identical bytes is a
   different fact from either party being able to run them, and only one of the
   two was ever checked.
10. **A rule nobody checks is a claim.** The 150-line rule was published,
    audited by hand three times, and still drifted. It stopped drifting the day
    a command returned a non-zero status.
