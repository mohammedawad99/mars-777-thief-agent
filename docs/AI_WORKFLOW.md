# AI Workflow - group MaRs-777

> **Status: DRAFT.**

## Roles

- The **human** receives a prompt from the supervising reviewer.
- **Claude Code** performs repository and terminal work inside a single repository.
- Claude returns an **evidence report** (exact commands + results).
- Work is **reviewed** before any commit or push.

## Principles

- No implementation before an approved plan.
- No commit/push without explicit instruction.
- Exact command/result reporting; explicit statement of what was not verified.
- Stage prompt texts (e.g., Stage 0A through Stage 0C) may be recorded or
  referenced in `docs/PROMPTS.md` **without** including any secrets.
- Stage 0C established the two private GitHub remotes (HTTPS, owner
  mohammedawad99) and the `origin` configuration; commits and pushes happen only
  under explicit reviewer approval, and no authentication output or secret is
  ever recorded here.
