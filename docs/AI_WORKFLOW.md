- **Stage 4E — RESUME 3** was the first time a hard constraint - the 150-line rule - actually
  shaped the work rather than merely being satisfied by it. The module was at 132 lines and the
  new family needed about 32. There were three ways out and only one of them was honest. I could
  have invented a base class or a registry and called it design; that would have added an
  abstraction to solve a file-length problem, and the stage instructions rightly forbade it. I
  could have moved the family to a new module on my own initiative, which is a real option but an
  architectural decision, not an implementation one. Or I could reclaim lines from prose.
  Prose reclamation is the option that sounds safest and is actually the easiest to get wrong,
  because "I only touched comments" is exactly the kind of claim people make right before they
  have not only touched comments. So I stopped asserting it and proved it instead: parse both
  revisions, strip every docstring, compare the ASTs. `TurnCursor`, `Commitment`,
  `Acknowledgement` and `_require_int` came back executable-AST identical with `Reveal` the only
  added name. That check took a minute to write and converted a promise into evidence, which is
  the same move that made the clean-parent RED replay worth doing two stages ago.
  The squeeze itself was still unpleasant, and worth recording as a smell rather than a triumph.
  I compressed four docstrings, mangled a sentence at one point and had to repair it, and landed
  at exactly 150/150 with zero headroom. The file is compliant and the contracts survived intact,
  but "compliant with nothing to spare" is a warning, not a win: the next family cannot go in
  there at all. Saying that plainly in the report - rather than quietly celebrating that it fit -
  is what turned it into the R6 agenda instead of a trap for whoever writes family four.
  One smaller thing worth keeping. The test that mattered most here was the *old* one. Running
  the committed `test_peer_messages.py` unmodified, after Reveal existed, produced exactly one
  failure for exactly the right reason - its blocked-family list still said `Reveal`. Observing
  that before editing it is what makes the subsequent one-line change maintenance rather than
  convenience, and it is now the third stage in a row where the discipline of looking before
  editing paid for itself.
- **Stage 4E-R5** is the stage where the *process* step I had previously treated as ceremony
  actually paid for itself twice. The R4 close had ordered a mandatory mechanical impact scan
  before any edit, and R4's own desk audit had predicted the affected files. The scan disagreed
  with that prediction in both directions: `app/__init__.py` turned out to need no change at all,
  and two constraints nobody had written down turned up in `tests/app/test_turn_boundaries.py` -
  a subprocess probe that pins the `app.turn_service` import path, and a vocabulary scan that
  forbids words like `commitment` anywhere in that module's source. The second one rejected my
  first migration docstring, which had cheerfully explained *why* the types moved by naming the
  future commitment producer. The test was right and the docstring was wrong: a layer-purity
  guard that only fails on real imports and not on prose would be a weaker guard.
  The bigger lesson was the Thief migration. I copied Police's finished `turn_service.py` across
  with a package-name substitution, exactly as I had legitimately done for byte-identical files
  earlier in the project, and broke six Thief role tests instantly. The two services are *not*
  the same file: the thief refuses a barrier through its own capability policy. The habit that
  worked for `domain/actions.py`, which genuinely is role-neutral and byte-identical, is wrong
  for a file whose whole point is role-specific behaviour. The fix was to restore Thief's file
  from its own HEAD and apply the same *delta* rather than the same *content* - and the useful
  generalization is that cross-repo mirroring is a property of the file, not of the project, so
  it has to be decided per file rather than assumed.
  Worth noting what the regression suite did here: it caught the error in seconds, and it caught
  it because the role tests exist and are specific. That is the second time in this stage a test
  I did not write during this stage did the work. The migration itself was mechanically dull -
  move three classes down, re-export them, prove there is exactly one of each - and the only
  design judgement was the error boundary, which the supervisor settled cleanly: malformed domain
  value is a `DomainError`, malformed message composition is a `ValueError`, and Reveal never
  constructs an action so the two never meet.
- **Stage 4E-R4** is the second time going back to the primary text changed the answer, and
  it is worth recording *which* part it changed. The semantics were already right after R3:
  `move` is the generic physical action. What R4 had to settle was smaller and harder — where
  that action *lives* in the code, and how its *bytes* are written. Neither is in the book, and
  that is exactly the point. Chapter 5 page 53's `commit(state, move: str, …)` is the closest
  thing the source has to an answer, and the book itself labels that core a simplification. It
  would have been very easy to read `move: str` as permission to seal `"N"` and `"BARRIER:3,4"`
  and call it source-backed. It is not source-backed; it is a sample.
  So the honest classification is that the *semantics* are SOURCE-REQUIRED, byte-identical
  recomputation is SOURCE-ENTAILED, and the tagged `{kind,value}` shape we chose is
  **PROJECT-CONTRACT** that a second group has to agree to before counted play. Saying that
  plainly is what lets the existing NDEC-001 echo carry it — and what stopped us inventing an
  `action_codec` field to negotiate something the config hash already pins.
  The reuse discipline mattered more than the new design here. The barrier's exact cell is
  `[row,col]` because JDEC-006 and JDEC-012 already locked that array for `state`; the movement
  token is a `move_set` value because Appendix F fixes that vocabulary; the tag is `ActionKind`'s
  existing `MOVE`/`BARRIER` because inventing a parallel vocabulary would have created a second
  authority for one fact. Almost nothing in this reconciliation is new — the work was proving
  which existing contract already owned each piece, and then not duplicating it.
  The one genuinely new thing is a module, and even that was forced by arithmetic rather than
  taste: `domain.rules` is 118 lines, the action types do not fit under 150, and legality is a
  different responsibility from the action value anyway. The migration note is the part I expect
  to matter later — `domain.actions` and `app.turn_service`'s local copies must never both be
  alive, so the implementation slice is atomic by construction, and it changes a construction
  error from `ApplicationError` to `DomainError`. Writing that expected test change down now,
  while it is a design consequence, is cheaper than discovering it mid-slice and calling it a
  surprise.
# AI Workflow - group MaRs-777

> **Status: DRAFT.**

## Roles

- The **human** receives a prompt from the supervising reviewer.
- **Claude Code** performs repository and terminal work inside a single repository.
- Claude returns an **evidence report** (exact commands + results).
- Work is **reviewed** before any commit or push.

## Principles

- No implementation before an approved plan.
- No commit/push without explicit instruction.
- Exact command/result reporting; explicit statement of what was not verified.
- Stage prompt texts (e.g., Stage 0A through Stage 0C) may be recorded or
  referenced in `docs/PROMPTS.md` **without** including any secrets.
- Stage 0C established the two private GitHub remotes (owner mohammedawad99) and
  the `origin` configuration (**SSH** transport); commits and pushes happen only
  under explicit reviewer approval, and no authentication output or secret is
  ever recorded here.
- **Stage 1-SYNC** adopted the reviewed **common** Stage-1 specification baseline by
  **one-way synchronization** from the Police repository's locked commit
  `691280dc3219452eeff462c997714fd5bcbd9e55` (documentation only). The specification
  stages 1A–1D.1 were executed and reviewed **in the Police repository**; this
  repository did **not** perform that extraction and does not claim to have. The two
  repositories keep separate Git history, package namespaces (`mars777_thief` here),
  runtime state, and future strategy. See `SOURCES.md` and `DECISIONS.md` D15.
- **Phase 2 (Stages 2A → 2-CLOSE)** froze the architecture and authored all seven PRDs.
  Stage 2-CLOSE resolved the two final cross-contract issues **without changing any locked
  contract**: the series convention is negotiated protocol metadata (not a declaration field)
  and the declared MCP endpoint is a stable group-level ingress. **PRD-01…07 are
  APPROVED — PHASE 2 LOCKED; implementation has NOT started.**
- **Phase 3 (Stage 3A →)** is the first implementation phase. Stage 3A was driven
  **tests-first**: every domain test was written and observed failing in both repositories
  before any production module existed. It delivers only the deterministic, role-neutral
  foundation - grid configuration, coordinates, board geometry with blocked cells, the
  five-token move set, movement legality and safe move application. The project grid
  minimum is enforced by `GridConfig`, deliberately **not** by the policy-free `Board`
  geometry, per the frozen domain-layer boundary. **PRD-01…07 remain APPROVED — PHASE 2
  LOCKED**; the deterministic core is **not** complete and no protocol, networking,
  cryptography, strategy, GUI or reporting code exists.
- **Stage 3B** completed the deterministic game-rule layer tests-first: barriers,
  capture, terminal/survival, scoring and bounded scent physics. Two supervising
  corrections were applied. **JDEC-015** records a source *gap* — Appendix F fixes two
  independent MINIMUM-35 step limits but Ch 3 Table 2 defines no outcome when the
  ceiling precedes the survival threshold, so `survival_threshold <= max_moves` became
  an admissibility condition instead of an invented terminal. **C-10** records a source
  *contradiction* — Ch 4 §4.3 defines tau in [0, 0.9] yet writes the update with a lower
  clamp only, so the state domain wins and the recurrence saturates. Registers are now
  **JDEC-001…015** and **C-01…C-10**; every authoritative count is unchanged. Turn
  orchestration, protocol, networking, cryptography, strategy, GUI and reporting remain
  **not implemented**; PRD-01 stays **IN PROGRESS** and PRD-02…07 **NOT STARTED**.
- **Stage 3C** opened the application layer with the **local** turn-execution step,
  tests-first. Supervising review accepted it except for one state-ownership defect:
  `LocalTruth` carried a `barriers_placed` counter that duplicated the public board's
  barrier facts and could drift from them, and it was police-only state sitting in a
  role-neutral object. **Stage 3C-FIX1** removed it; remaining budget is derived from
  `max_barriers - len(board.blocked)`, and `STATE_OWNERSHIP.md` anti-duplication rule 2
  is satisfied. No architecture document was changed. **PRD-02 is now IN PROGRESS**
  for this one slice; the state machine, orchestrator, ports, FastMCP, networking and
  cryptography remain **not implemented**, and PRD-03…07 stay **NOT STARTED**.
- **Stage 4A** added the local protocol phase machine, tests-first, pinning the frozen
  graph literally rather than against the implementation: an exhaustive 324-pair sweep
  makes a hidden or missing edge impossible. Supervising review then found a genuine
  contradiction inside the frozen table itself - TECHNICAL_LOSS was absorbing although
  the same table makes "technical loss" an entry condition of SUBGAME_COMPLETE, tells
  the phase to "proceed per series rules", and excludes it from rule R5. **Stage
  4A-FIX1** added the single edge `TECHNICAL_LOSS -> SUBGAME_COMPLETE` and recorded the
  reasoning in `STATE_MACHINE.md` §4 as an implementation-discovered architecture
  correction - not a lecturer rule, not a source conflict, no register increment.
  Primary source agrees: Ch 3 Table 2 lists technical loss as a **sub-game** end event
  scored 0/0 beside capture and survival. TAMPERED keeps its severe, non-repairable
  status. PRD-06 remains **NOT STARTED** despite the crypto-named phases.
- **Stage 4B** added transition evidence, tests-first. The instructive part was what
  the stage did **not** build. The prompt allowed typed transition signals, but an
  audit of every source and architecture document found **no frozen transition-signal
  vocabulary** - `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md`'s 15 numbered events are protocol-timeline
  entries, not state-machine signals - so inventing a 31-value event enum would have
  created a second representation of a graph that already exists once. The target
  phase stayed the typed request. Likewise, the per-state Evidence column names
  artifacts, hashes and log entries, but event 10 fixes the *state machine's* share as
  literally "phase transition" with persistence and hashing both "—", so evidence is
  the two phases and nothing else. Supervising review then raised two close-critical
  points. **Stage 4B-FIX1** answered the first by making evidence **valid by
  construction**: R7 records a *successful* transition and R1/R5 forbid the skips, so
  a value naming a non-edge could never be truthful. Validation reuses `_ALLOWED`
  directly - one dict literal, one enum class in the module. That deleted the old
  negative test's subject, and the honest fix was to move the corruption boundary
  forward to the constructor and **add** replay negatives (duplicated record,
  out-of-position record) rather than relax the constructor to keep an obsolete test
  alive. The second point was a reported contradiction between a "153-line" file and
  "0 files over 150"; it resolved as a **units error in the report** - 153 was the
  cross-repo semantic-diff count, physical LOC was 150 - and a repository-wide sweep
  of all 48 `*.py` files per repo proved max 150 and 0 over. Throughout, the honest
  claim was kept narrow: structural validity is not authenticity, and phase replay is
  not game replay. PRD-06 and PRD-07 remain **NOT STARTED**.
- **Stage 4C** added the local orchestrator, tests-first, and its lesson was about
  *authority* rather than code. The ownership audit had to reconcile two frozen
  documents that disagree: `MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md` lists "turn cursor, sub-game
  index" as `app.orchestrator` state, while `STATE_OWNERSHIP.md` - the authority
  for mutable-state ownership - puts turn/step under `domain.truth`. The
  already-approved D17 precedent settled it, so no turn cursor was stored and no
  blocker was raised. The same audit found that the table *also* assigns the
  **recorded score** to the orchestrator; that responsibility was reported and
  **deferred**, not silently dropped and not quietly implemented, because its
  input is a terminal `Outcome` the local agent cannot yet know. Role alternation
  was likewise refused: PRD02-FR-011 makes it a negotiated `SeriesLauncher`
  convention with no silent default, so nothing was derived from an odd/even
  index. The real defect surfaced at review. Stage 4C had implemented the series
  length as a floor (`>= 6`) on the strength of one sentence in
  `CONFIG_CONTRACT.md` - "6 (or the agreed higher)" - without checking it against
  Appendix F's own status table, which lists `num_games` under **FIXED** and
  defines FIXED as "binding, unchangeable; deviation disqualifies". **Stage
  4C-FIX1** corrected the code to exact equality and, because the stale wording
  really was in the committed tree (in `CONFIG_CONTRACT.md` and the C-05 impact
  cell), narrowed those two sentences to the meaning App F and C-05 had already
  locked - no new JDEC, conflict or requirement. The lesson is the authority
  hierarchy the project already had: a derived contract sentence never outranks
  the Appendix-F status it is derived from. The error was caught before commit,
  and this record keeps it rather than hiding it.
- **Stage 4D** was authorized to build the application port contracts and instead
  stopped before writing a single line, which is the outcome the process is for.
  Three internal contradictions made a truthful implementation impossible:
  `API_BOUNDARIES.md` says in its own header "**No Python signatures are fixed
  here**", and a repository-wide search of every architecture and PRD document
  found no `def`, no `Protocol` and no return annotation - so every method name
  would have been invented; the `app.ports` row allowed **stdlib typing only**
  while the same architecture defines `GameRulesPort` over board/action/config and
  `ScoringPort` over outcome to per-role scores, leaving those ports
  unrepresentable in the module assigned to them; and `PLAN.md` still claimed 18
  ports where the frozen table has 20. The tempting move was to ship a thin
  `ClockPort` with a `monotonic() -> float`, since that is the one port whose input
  is "—" and whose headline output is a stdlib scalar. It was refused: the method
  name is not frozen, and the row's own Returns column also lists deadlines and
  timers whose machinery `CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` assigns to the Watchdog, the
  Deadline timers and the executor. Shipping a third of a port under its full name
  would have been an overclaim. **Stage 4D-R1** repaired the architecture instead
  of the symptom, changing exactly one cell of one module row - dependency
  inversion is aimed at concrete adapters, not at the domain model, and `app`
  already imports `domain` - and recorded that any future Python signature is a
  **PROJECT-CONTRACT**, never source- or reference-mandated. The analysis also
  found that not every row named `*Port` needs a Protocol: wrapping a pure
  deterministic domain function the orchestrator may already call directly adds
  indirection without substitutability. The blocked stage is kept in the record as
  evidence, not erased.
- **Stage 4E** stopped before code for the second time in a row, and the reconciliation
  that followed is the more interesting half. The stage was scoped to build internal
  semantic peer-message values in `protocol.messages`, and the audit found the home
  itself was wrong: that row is a **wire** boundary, while `CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` has
  the server "validate, convert to an **event**, and submit it to the executor queue" -
  and the Turn Executor is `app`. Since `app` may never import `protocol`, a semantic
  value the executor consumes simply cannot live there. That turned a naming debate
  into a proof. The second blocker looked worse: PRD02-FR-044 required every inbound
  message to carry `(sub_game, step, phase)`, yet nothing anywhere defines step
  numbering, the pre-turn value, or what `phase` even denotes. The temptation was a
  `step=0` sentinel. Instead the answer came from inside PRD-02: **FR-063**, the
  requirement that actually names the "cursor guard" and traces to R8 exactly as
  FR-044 does, lists only **sub-game and step**, while the phase rejection is
  **FR-062** under **STATE-003** - a receiver-side check against the receiver's own
  machine. A state-machine walk confirmed it: turns are lockstep, so a transmitted
  phase is either constant per message family (redundant) or not independently
  computable (peers sit in different phases at the same moment). Narrowing FR-044
  dissolved the phase-dependency blocker for free, because nothing needs to transmit a
  phase at all - and the single `ProtocolPhase` stayed exactly where it was. The audit
  also caught an omission in the project's own earlier planning: the peer-visible
  family count is **10**, not 9; Event 8 "Move validation" transmits accept/reject and
  had been dropped. Both the blocked stage and the miscount are kept in the record.
- **Stage 4F** audited nine value representations and stopped before code again, this
  time on a subtler problem: two representations were genuinely ready, but there was
  nowhere legal to put them. A SHA-256 digest is produced by `protocol.commitment` and
  `protocol.config_lock` and carried by `app.peer_messages`, and no module in the frozen
  table was reachable by all three. The easy answers were both wrong - duplicating the
  validator per layer would have created the semantic drift the anti-duplication rule
  exists to prevent, and a `types.py` would have been the junk drawer the stage brief
  explicitly forbade. **Stage 4F-R1** fixed it by first correcting the project's own
  analysis: `infra.logger`, `infra.artifacts` and `infra.reporter` had been listed as
  consumers, but they are **mappers** - they serialize whatever structured record they
  are handed, and that record already reaches them through `app.ports`. With the real
  consumer set down to three, one inner contract module plus two narrow type-reference
  dependencies sufficed, reusing the pattern Stage 4E-R1 had already established. Two
  representation defects surfaced in the same review. The digest had been called
  ready while its case policy was called unresolved - a contradiction in one report;
  resolving it meant separating **algorithm** (SOURCE), **encoding** (project-locked
  hex), **length** (entailed by SHA-256) and **case** (genuinely free), then adopting
  lowercase as a labelled PROJECT-CONTRACT that **rejects** uppercase rather than
  silently rewriting it. And `RESULT_CONTRACT.md` turned out to define
  `mutual_agreement` as a bool in its field table, scoring rule and example while its
  approval-core prose treated it as an object whose `.sha256` duplicated the separate
  `result_sha256` - the prose was the stale side, and correcting it kept the locked
  11-field result count intact. Seven representations remain deferred rather than
  guessed.
- **Stage 4F resumed** and delivered the two values the reconciliation had made
  placeable, and the interesting part was again what supervising review caught after
  the tests were green. The implementation was correct on every semantic axis - strict
  lowercase 64-hex, uppercase refused rather than normalised, no hashing, the closed
  `Verified OK` / `TAMPERED` pair - yet `InvalidDigestError` subclassed bare
  `Exception`. That looked harmless until you noticed its sibling in the same module:
  `FinalAuditVerdict("OK")` raises `ValueError` natively, so the two values disagreed
  about what a malformed construction *is*, and a caller writing `except ValueError`
  would have caught one and missed the other. It was also the only application error
  missing from a package surface that exports every other one. **Stage 4F-RESUME-FIX1**
  fixed both in two lines of production change, driven by a fresh RED of six failures.
  The lesson is that an API can be semantically flawless and still be inconsistent with
  the language it is written in, and with the project's own conventions - neither the
  test suite nor the type checker had any reason to complain.
- **Stage 4E-R2** was scheduled to unblock message implementation, and its most useful
  output was three *refusals*. Paying the tracked debt was straightforward - the
  `app.peer_messages` row allowed only "stdlib typing" and could not name
  `app.protocol_values`, so a message literally could not hold the `Sha256Digest` the
  previous stage had built for it - and the fix rhymed with 4F-R1-FIX1 closely enough
  to be routine. What was not routine was declining to grant `enum` "while we are in
  there": no peer message defines a vocabulary of its own, `Move` and
  `FinalAuditVerdict` already exist, and a permission granted early is a permission
  someone eventually uses. The cycle question got the same treatment: rather than
  writing "`app.protocol_values` must not import `app.peer_messages`" as a rule to be
  obeyed, the note records that it *cannot*, because its allow-list is pure stdlib -
  a structural argument needs no discipline to hold.
  Then the family audit contradicted the plan. The stage brief flagged Reveal and
  Mutual result agreement as high-priority likely-ready; both turned out blocked, and
  for reasons no amount of enthusiasm could paper over. A police turn may legally be a
  barrier placement instead of a move, and BAR-001 requires the **exact cell** to be
  declared openly - yet every contract describing the reveal says `move` + `hint`, so a
  `(cursor, Move, hint)` record cannot express a legal police turn at all. That is not
  a missing field; it is a missing contract. And result agreement failed on a residue:
  Stage 4F-R1 corrected `RESULT_CONTRACT.md`'s `mutual_agreement` from object to bool
  but never reached NDEC-006, which still says `.confirmed`. Worse, the corrected
  contract sets the bool *after* the peers exchange hashes, so a single message cannot
  honestly carry both its own digest and a verdict about agreement it has not yet
  reached. Acknowledgement was the opposite case - two of its three open questions
  dissolved once PRD06-FR-082 was read properly (the ack binds a *specific* digest for
  a *specific* cursor, which settles both whether the digest is repeated and whether
  `ack_of_step` is a second field) leaving one genuinely open question about the acking
  role. One family out of ten survived: Commitment, whose timeline row says
  "`H_commit` **only**", the rarest thing in this specification - an explicit
  exclusivity statement. The lesson is that a readiness audit that returns the answer
  the brief expected has probably not been performed.
- **Stage 4E-R2-FIX1** was scoped as a two-item cleanup and turned into a lesson about
  how far a withdrawn decision travels. Supervising review had spotted that NDEC-006
  still carried the `mutual_agreement.sha256` / `.confirmed` object form Stage 4F-R1
  removed from `RESULT_CONTRACT.md`, and the instruction was to correct that one cell.
  Correcting it was easy. Running the sweep the instruction implied - every current
  occurrence, classified CURRENT versus HISTORICAL - was not: the same withdrawn shape
  is still asserted by **PRD06-FR-142**, **PRD07-FR-085** and **PRD07-FR-190**, and
  FR-085 contradicts FR-080 four rows above it in the same table. Stage 4F-R1 had
  corrected the document it was looking at and, reasonably, assumed that was the
  contract; Stage 4E-R2 then found one more and, equally reasonably, assumed *that* was
  the last. Both were wrong for the same reason: nobody had asked "where else does this
  shape live?" until a sweep was mandated. The honest consequence is that this stage
  closes **PARTIAL** - the object form is gone from `docs/spec/**` but is not extinct,
  and the PASS wording would have asserted it was.
  The provenance turned out to be the interesting part. The nesting is not a project
  invention: it is the shape of the lecturer's extracted attachment example, recorded as
  secondary provenance, which PRD07-FR-087 already says is not a verified parser schema.
  It reached three PRDs because attachment compatibility was in view while they were
  written. That reframes the remaining fix from "correct an error" to "stop treating a
  compatibility example as a contract" - and it means no source requirement is at risk,
  because Ch 9 requires a SHA-256-backed mutual approval, never a nesting.
  The error-contract half went the other way: the audit *reduced* the plan. The obvious
  move was a narrow `ValueError` subclass, matching `InvalidDigestError` next door. But
  the same module also contains `FinalAuditVerdict`, which raises **native** `ValueError`
  and has a test asserting exactly that - so the project already had a precedent for a
  new semantic value needing no custom error, and `InvalidDigestError` being a
  `ValueError` subclass means one `except ValueError` covers both modules regardless.
  The deciding argument was asymmetry: adding a narrow subclass later is non-breaking,
  removing one is not. So the contract is built-in `ValueError`, zero supporting types,
  written down now rather than discovered during TDD - which was the actual point of the
  exercise.
- **Stage 4E-R2-FIX2** was the cleanup FIX1's PARTIAL had scoped, and it is worth
  recording how ordinary it turned out to be once the sweep had already been done. The
  three PRD rows were corrected in place in a few minutes; the hard work had been the
  sweep that found them, one stage earlier. The lesson generalises: a contract
  correction is cheap, and *knowing where the contract is asserted* is what costs. Two
  stages had each corrected the one document in front of them and stopped.
  The genuinely interesting half was the constant dependency, because it looked like a
  formality and was not. The `app.peer_messages` row permitted "immutable `domain` value
  **types**". `FIRST_SUB_GAME` and `FIXED_NUM_GAMES` are not types - they are
  module-level `Final[int]` constants - so the row did not authorize them, and the
  tempting move was to read "value types" loosely and move on. That is exactly the
  reading this project has now refused three times: at 4D-R1 for `app.ports`, at
  4F-R1-FIX1 for `app.protocol_values`, and here. An allow-list that is only true if you
  squint is not an allow-list.
  Choosing the fix required rejecting three plausible alternatives. A literal `6` in the
  message module, or a copied constant, would have created a *second* authority for a
  number Appendix F marks FIXED with "deviation disqualifies" - the cheapest possible way
  to lose a match years from now. Deriving the bound from a `SeriesConfig`, which was
  already permitted and therefore needed no architecture change at all, was the subtlest
  wrong answer: it would have made a *transmitted* cursor look like it depended on locked
  configuration it does not carry, or forced a third field onto a value frozen at two.
  The bound a cursor needs is the global constant, not a config value, and those are
  different things even when they hold the same integer. Checking the claim mechanically
  was worth the thirty seconds: exactly one `= 6` exists in the source tree, and
  `app.orchestrator` was already importing `FIRST_SUB_GAME` at runtime - so the widening
  documented a dependency the codebase had been relying on lawfully all along, which is
  the most comfortable kind of architecture correction to make.
- **Stage 4E finally resumed**, ten reconciliation stages after it was first blocked, and
  the striking thing is how small the result is: two classes, 96 lines. Everything that
  made it possible was the argument, not the code. The module could not have been written
  in the shape the original Stage-4E prompt imagined - there was no legal home for the
  values, no permission to hold a digest, no permission to read the sub-game bound, and
  nine of the ten families still have no frozen payload. What shipped is precisely the
  part that survived every audit.
  Two implementation choices are worth recording because both were tempting to get wrong.
  The first is `type(x) is TurnCursor` instead of `isinstance`. That looks pedantic until
  you write the adversarial test: a `Sha256Digest` subclass can override `__post_init__`
  and thereby *weaken* the validation the composition is relying on, and `isinstance`
  would wave it through. Exact identity refuses it. The second is the deliberate absence
  of an upper bound on `step`. Every instinct says a step number should be bounded, and
  `max_moves` is sitting right there in the config - but it is *per-sub-game locked*
  configuration, and a transmitted cursor does not carry it. Embedding it would have made
  a structural contract silently depend on state the value has no access to, which is the
  same category of error as the "value types" wording that blocked this module twice. The
  test that proves the point accepts `step = 10**9` and says why.
  The RED came twice, which is the useful part of the record: once for the missing module,
  and once - after the implementation was complete and correct - for the missing export on
  the exhaustive public surface. The second failure is the one a less strict convention
  would never have caught, and it is the same class of defect Stage 4F-RESUME-FIX1 found
  by review rather than by test. This time the test found it first.
- **Stage 4E-R3** is the clearest example so far of why "read the source, not your own
  notes" is a rule and not a slogan. Stage 4E-R2 had blocked Reveal on a finding I still
  believe was correctly reported: no *project* contract said how a police barrier and its
  exact cell reach the peer, and a `(cursor, Move, hint)` record could not express a legal
  police turn. What R2 never did was go back to the book. Chapter 5 page 51 defines the
  sealed `Move` as "the physical action - the chosen action (movement, **barrier
  placement**, etc.)", and the Reveal step sends "the action (Move) and the verbal
  sentence". Chapter 3 page 37 adds that a turn is a single action, that the police may
  place a barrier only in a turn where he forgoes movement, and that every placement and
  its **exact location** must be declared truthfully and never in hiding. The source had
  answered the question all along; our derived contracts had quietly narrowed "action" to
  "move" and then the narrowing propagated. That is a documentation defect of exactly the
  kind the `mutual_agreement` nesting was - a wrong shape copied forward until someone
  went back to the primary text.
  The honest consequence is mixed, which is the point. Reveal did **not** become ready: the
  semantics are now settled, but there is still no shared action *type* in a home both the
  commitment producer and the message module can reach, and the sealed `move` value's
  canonical representation is unfrozen where `state`'s was frozen years of stages ago by
  NDEC-002. Those are smaller and much better-named blockers than "no contract says how a
  barrier reaches the peer", but they are real, and inventing a JSON shape to close them
  would have broken commit/reveal verification for a peer who agreed a different one.
  Acknowledgement went the other way and cost almost nothing. The whole source content is
  one sentence - the opponent confirms it received the commitment and is locked onto it -
  and the `by_role` question dissolved once it was asked precisely: the book names an
  acknowledging party, but Figure 6 carries that party as the *direction of an arrow
  between two lifelines*, not as a field. A local writer always knows the direction, and
  the role is frozen at config lock, so the log can persist `by_role` truthfully while the
  message never carries it. The nice side effect is a security one nobody asked for: a
  field that is never transmitted is a field a hostile peer cannot forge.
- **Stage 4E — RESUME 2** produced a correct implementation and a defective *audit trail*, and the
  two failed independently. The code was never in doubt: `Acknowledgement` is two members that
  Stage 4E-R3 had already frozen, and the replay later reproduced both production files
  byte-identically from the contract alone. What went wrong is that the first attempt was
  interrupted, and the next session opened on a worktree that already contained that attempt's
  test file *and* its production code. The stage instruction said STOP on drift. I did not stop.
  I judged the drift to be inside the stage's own authorized scope, verified it against the
  contract, and — because I still owed a RED — restored production to HEAD around the
  already-written test, observed the `ImportError`, and put production back.
  Every one of those statements was reported honestly, and the report still failed review, which
  is the lesson worth keeping. A reconstructed RED proves the *test* is red against the baseline.
  It does not prove the *implementation* was derived from a failing test, because the test and the
  implementation had already met before I arrived. Those are different claims, and only the second
  one is what "tests-first" asserts. Disclosure does not upgrade the weaker claim into the
  stronger one; it only makes the substitution visible enough for someone to reject.
  The repair was cheap and should have been the first move: restore both repositories to the exact
  committed parents with `git show`, re-measure the clean baseline (721/716), write only the test
  file, SHA-confirm production equal to HEAD *at the moment of RED*, and implement afterwards. The
  replay also surfaced something the first pass had buried — the committed `test_peer_messages.py`
  failing on its own now-stale blocked-family list. In the interrupted attempt that edit already
  existed and read as an unexplained deviation; in the replay it appears where it belongs, as an
  observed failure with a one-line, coverage-preserving correction. Same edit, completely
  different standing, purely because of when it was seen.
  The generalizable rule: when a stage says stop on drift, the drift is not evidence about the
  code, it is evidence about the *process*, and no amount of after-the-fact verification of the
  code substitutes for that. Restarting from the committed parent cost one session and bought a
  provenance chain that survives review. Carrying the drift forward cost a full review cycle and
  bought nothing.
- **Stage 4E-R6** is the stage where two habits the project built up finally paid off at the
  same time, and one of them was uncomfortable. The comfortable one was measurement. The module
  question - where do the next message families live - looks like an architecture-taste question,
  and I could have argued for any of four shapes. Counting settled it in about a minute: the
  obvious answer, move the four existing values into one new module, lands at roughly 145 lines
  and hits the identical wall one family later. That is not a matter of preference, it is
  arithmetic, and it eliminated the option that would otherwise have felt tidiest.
  The uncomfortable habit was going back to the book instead of to our own timeline. Our
  `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md` has said for many stages that event 8 transmits *accept/reject* and
  event 12 transmits *audit verdicts*. Figure 6 on page 52 draws exactly four arrows, and neither
  of those is among them. Chasing the wording back, the only "accepted" in the whole book is the
  return value of the minimal FastMCP example server - the same snippet Stage 4E-R3 already
  declined to promote when it was tempting to read it as an acknowledgement schema. It was
  tempting for the same reason twice: it is the only concrete shape anywhere near the topic.
  So both families moved sideways rather than forward, and the honest report is that one blocker
  label was simply wrong. #8 was carrying `BLOCKED-BY-VALUE-REPRESENTATION` long after R4 and R5
  had actually solved value representation, and #12 was carrying `BLOCKED-BY-ASSOCIATION-SHAPE`
  even though the association is spelled out in section 5.4 and the log contract. Stale blocker
  labels are worse than blunt ones, because they send the next stage to fix something already
  fixed. Only the third family genuinely advanced, and it advanced because a single small gap -
  what a nonce actually looks like - could be closed inside an existing NDEC rather than by
  inventing a new one.
  The thing I want to remember: a reconciliation stage's most valuable output can be *demoting
  its own previous conclusions*. Two of three results here were "we were describing this wrongly",
  and only one was "this is now ready". A stage that reported three green lights would have been
  more satisfying and considerably less true.
- **Stage 4E-R6-FIX1** caught me doing the thing this project keeps warning about, in a new
  disguise. I froze a nonce representation and justified it with a sentence that sounded
  cryptographic and was simply false: that peers disagreeing on lettercase or length "cannot
  recompute identical bytes". They can. The receiver rebuilds the sealed record from the exact
  string the sender revealed, so the format is irrelevant to the arithmetic. The rule I wanted
  was defensible - strict parsing, invariance under our own NFC step, a 128-bit entropy floor -
  but I reached for a *necessity* argument when only a *policy* argument was available, and a
  necessity argument is exactly the kind that stops anyone asking whether the rule is negotiable.
  The related slip was making "CSPRNG-produced" part of a value's contract. A constructor handed
  a received string cannot possibly verify how it was generated; that is a producer duty and a
  runtime invariant, not something a dataclass can assert. Writing it into the representation
  would have created a check that reads as a guarantee and delivers nothing.
  The second thing this fix surfaced was a real gap in the previous stage's honesty about
  readiness. I had called the family READY while leaving the type inventory - value name, home,
  error category, entry shape, tuple strictness, empty-batch rule - to whoever implemented it.
  That is not readiness, it is deferral wearing readiness's label, and the same standard that
  made me demote two other families should have applied here. Re-auditing it also overturned my
  own batch assumption: I had written "spans all six sub-games", and the project's own locked
  artifact is one log file *per* sub-game with its own final_reveal and audit result. The source
  term is genuinely ambiguous, so the boundary is a project reading and is now labelled as one.
- **Stage 4E-R6-FIX2** is the sequel to the previous fix and a sharper lesson than it. Having
  been corrected for over-claiming that a fixed nonce format was *necessary*, I softened the
  wording in the obvious direction: I said the format was our default and that a peer proposing
  another deterministic form could be accommodated by agreement. That sounds appropriately
  humble and it quietly broke the contract, because in the same stage I had frozen `NonceValue`
  to accept exactly thirty-two lowercase hex characters. A negotiation clause that admits a
  value the semantic type rejects is not flexibility, it is two contracts disagreeing, and the
  disagreement would have surfaced as a peer we had promised to accommodate being refused by our
  own constructor.
  The real distinction I had blurred is between *negotiating which codec to use* and *confirming
  that both sides require the same one*. Our NDEC rows are the second thing. For v1 there is one
  supported nonce representation, both peers echo it before config lock, and a mismatch refuses
  counted play there - not at audit, not by normalising the other side's value, and not through
  an invented sanction. Supporting a second representation is a version change with code behind
  it, not a sentence in a table.
  Two smaller corrections rode along, and both are the same species of imprecision. Thirty-two
  hex characters fix a *width*, not entropy - only the producer's CSPRNG supplies randomness, and
  a constructor validating syntax proves nothing about it. And ASCII-hex stability under our NFC
  step is a parsing-safety property, not the reason recomputation would otherwise fail. Each time
  I reached for the strongest-sounding justification available rather than the true one; the
  pattern is worth naming, because it survived one correction and came back in a new form.
- **Stage 4E-R7** is the first stage where I broke something mid-flight, and the interesting
  part is what caught it. The migration needed to lift five definitions out of one module and
  drop them into two others *without changing a character of them*. My first helper sliced the
  blocks by hardcoded line numbers, which is the kind of shortcut that works right up until it
  does not: an assertion on the expected last line of a block failed - by one line - after the
  façade had already been written over the source module. For a moment the only copy of those
  definitions was in git.
  That is exactly why the recovery was boring rather than dramatic. Restore from HEAD, verify
  the hash matches the byte-for-byte value recorded in the baseline step, delete the partial
  modules, start again. The baseline hashes existed because the stage instructions asked for
  them before any edit, and they turned a potential reconstruction job into a thirty-second
  `git show`. The retry then used AST-derived ranges and re-parsed every extracted block to
  prove it matched the original definition *before* writing anything - which is what I should
  have done first, since the whole task was "move this without changing it" and an AST is the
  only thing that actually knows where a definition begins and ends.
  The second lesson is about what counts as proof of a behaviour-preserving move. The strongest
  evidence is not my new tests - it is the three committed behaviour test modules passing with
  **zero edits**. My layout tests can only check the things I thought to check; the old tests
  check the things the project already decided mattered, and they were written before this
  migration existed. Any temptation to "just update" one of them would have quietly converted
  the acceptance criterion into something I controlled.
  A smaller thing worth keeping: my own layout test initially scanned raw module source for the
  string "peer_messages" to prove there was no back edge, and it failed on a docstring that
  merely *mentions* the façade. Prose is not an import. Rewriting it to inspect `ImportFrom`
  nodes with `level == 1` made it both correct and stronger, and the same distinction bit twice
  in this stage - a grep for `^class ` also reports the façade's docstring line beginning "class
  objects". Text search is a fine way to find candidates and a poor way to prove structure.
- **Stage 4E-R8** was the first stage in a while with no correction to make, and the reason is
  worth recording rather than enjoyed. Everything hard about it had already been argued out in
  R6, FIX1 and FIX2 - what a nonce is allowed to look like, why that shape is a project contract
  and *not* a mathematical requirement of recomputation, and that one batched message per peer
  per sub-game is what Figure 6 actually draws. Implementation was then almost mechanical,
  which is the shape a frozen contract is supposed to produce.
  The one judgement that still had to be made in code is the one I would defend hardest:
  `NonceValue("0" * 32)` constructs successfully. It looks like a bug and reads like a missing
  check, and a reviewer skimming the file would reasonably flag it. But a constructor handed a
  *received* string cannot distinguish a CSPRNG output from a typed-out run of zeros - the
  entropy is a property of how the value was produced, not of the characters. Rejecting
  low-entropy-looking values would buy nothing and would falsely advertise a guarantee the type
  cannot make. So the test asserts the acceptance explicitly, with the reason next to it, which
  turns a suspicious line into a documented boundary.
  The same instinct decided the batch. Empty tuples, duplicate cursors, descending steps and
  mixed sub-games all construct, and each of those is asserted on purpose. A value object that
  refused them would have to know which steps were actually played, which sub-game is current
  and which nonces it has already seen - that is game state, and a semantic value that reaches
  for game state stops being a value. Structural validation answers "is this the right shape";
  everything that needs context stays LIVE. Writing the permissive cases down as tests is what
  stops a later stage from quietly "fixing" them.
  Two smaller habits paid off again. Both historical tests were run unchanged against the new
  production code *first*, so their failures are evidence rather than an inconvenience - the
  blocked-family tuple genuinely stopped being true the moment `FinalNonceReveal` existed, and
  the R7 layout test genuinely stopped being true the moment the finalization module stopped
  being empty. And when the layout test was updated it was made *stronger*, asserting the exact
  class inventory of that module rather than merely that it is no longer empty; a maintenance
  edit that only loosens an assertion is a lost test.
- **Stage 4E-R9** is the first stage that produced nothing and was right to. The instruction
  allowed it to continue straight into implementation if the dependency audit came back clean, and
  the temptation to find it clean was real: five of the eight sealed members were exact, the
  canonical JSON rules were fully frozen, and I could have written an action mapper and a
  canonical-JSON helper in an hour. What stopped me was asking what the tests would prove. The
  stage mandated known-answer digest vectors, and a digest vector needs all eight members - so a
  partial codec ships with tests that assert `codec_output == codec_output`, which is the exact
  anti-pattern the same instruction named a page earlier. A module whose tests cannot fail is
  worse than no module, because it looks like progress.
  The `role` blocker is the one I would have missed a few stages ago. Four spellings existed -
  `Cop`/`Thief` in the book's Figure 6, `police`/`thief` in the log contract, `POLICE`/`THIEF` in
  our own Python, `cop`/`thief` in the PRD-01 score keys - and the lowercase form *looked* frozen
  because it appears in a locked document's Type column. The thing that settled it was noticing
  that the same column describes `state` as `string/object`, which is demonstrably not a frozen
  representation. A column that is a type sketch for one field cannot be serialization law for
  another. That is a generalisable check: before treating a value as frozen, look at what else
  the same sentence or the same column says about a field you already know is open.
- **Stage 4E-R9-R1** then had to resolve those three, and the interesting decision was where the
  new semantic types would live. My first instinct was `app.protocol_values` - it already holds
  `Sha256Digest` and `NonceValue`, so it is the obvious shelf. It is also full, at 137 of 150
  lines, and I noticed I was reaching for that fact as the argument. It is the weaker one. The
  real reason is that `app.protocol_values` is contractually stdlib-pure, and `SealedState` must
  hold a `domain.board.Position`; putting it there would quietly widen a boundary that was drawn
  deliberately at 4F-R1. I wrote the boundary argument first and the LOC fact second, marked as
  secondary, because if the module had been empty the answer would have been the same.
  The other three candidates each failed on one edge: `domain` cannot import `app` (where the
  digest lives), `protocol.commitment` would force `app.turn_service` to import outward, and the
  peer-message modules are the wrong owner because **the sealed record is never transmitted** -
  it is the one thing in this protocol that is deliberately never sent. Naming that out loud is
  what made the choice obvious rather than arbitrary.
  A smaller thing worth recording: `ensure_ascii` had a locked value all along, in PRD06-FR-005,
  and three spec documents that implementers actually read said only "fixed & agreed". A value
  that exists in exactly one artifact nobody consults at implementation time is, in practice, an
  implementation-time choice. Freezing a decision and *placing* it are two different jobs.
- **Stage 4E-R9-R2** had one moment worth recording, and it happened before any production
  code existed. The `SealedState` test file came out at 169 lines against a hard 150-line rule,
  and the cheap fixes were all available: drop the parametrised cases down to one representative
  each, merge the unsorted and duplicate tests, delete the docstrings explaining *why* a
  permissive case is deliberate. Every one of those would have kept the file under the limit and
  quietly reduced what the file proves.
  The split was the honest move: shape, composition and immutability in one file, the barrier
  ordering contract in another. That contract had earned its own file anyway - it is the single
  place where two honest peers most easily diverge, because barriers are logically a set and
  serializing a set without a fixed order is exactly how byte-identity breaks. Splitting also
  happened *while still tests-first*, so it cost nothing and disturbed no evidence. The general
  rule I want to keep: a line limit is a signal about how many responsibilities a file has taken
  on, not an instruction to say less about the same ones.
  Two smaller judgements. `True` had to be rejected as a `step` by **exact type**, because in
  Python a bool *is* an int and a `step >= 1` check alone would have cheerfully accepted `True`
  as step 1 - the kind of thing that surfaces months later as a step-numbering bug. And when the
  test tried to prove an `ActorRole` subclass is refused, `type("LooseRole", (ActorRole,), {})`
  raised `AttributeError` from deep inside the enum machinery rather than the `TypeError` I
  expected. The dynamic call bypasses the path the normal `class X(ActorRole)` statement takes.
  The instruction anticipated this and said to record the Python fact rather than invent a proxy,
  so the test now asserts the real behaviour: an `Enum` with members cannot be extended at all.
  The strongest evidence in the stage is the least dramatic - every committed test passed with
  **zero edits**. Three new types, a new module and three new exports, and nothing already agreed
  had to move.
- **Stage 4E-R9-RESUME** is the payoff for a stop that produced nothing. The original R9 halted
  `BLOCKED-BEFORE-CODE` with three sealed members unrepresented; two reconciliation stages later
  the same scope was written in one pass, with every test green on the first run after
  production. That is worth naming precisely, because the tempting lesson - "the stop cost two
  stages" - is backwards. Had I written the codec then, `role` would have been serialized as
  whichever of four spellings I happened to pick, and the error would have surfaced as a false
  TAMPERED against a real opponent, at which point the match is void with no appeal. The stop
  did not delay the work; it is the reason the work was writable at all.
  The single most valuable instruction in the stage was the external known-answer oracle. Three
  canonical strings and digests, produced independently of this repository, verified with a
  stdlib-only script *before any production existed*. That inverts the usual failure mode of
  codec tests: written after the fact, they record whatever the implementation happens to emit,
  and a test that computes its own expectation proves only self-consistency. Here the digest was
  a fact about the contract before it was a fact about my code, and my code had to meet it. If I
  had produced a different byte ordering, a `\u05e9` escape or a trailing newline, the failure
  would have been immediate and unarguable rather than discovered by an opponent.
  Two design choices are worth defending. `canonical_json_bytes` accepts only `str`, `int`,
  `list` and `dict`, and refuses `None`, `bool` and `float` - even though the wider
  canonicalization contract has rules for numbers and nulls in *other* artifacts. A sealed
  commitment record contains none of them, so implementing those rules now would mean writing
  untested branches against a contract this payload does not exercise. The narrow domain is
  extendable the day a payload needs it; a speculative general-purpose serializer is not
  something you can un-ship. And the module refuses a non-NFC string rather than normalising it,
  which looks unhelpful until you notice that silently repairing it one step before hashing would
  hide exactly the producer defect the NFC rule exists to catch.
  The last one is about not writing code: `recompute` does not exist. The obvious shape is a
  function named for the audit-time use, and I did not write it, because two implementations of
  one hash can drift and a drifting verifier reports tampering that never happened. Recomputation
  is `compute_commitment` called again with the revealed nonce, and the test says so explicitly
  rather than leaving it as a comment.
- **Stage 4E-R10** is the second stage that produced nothing, and unlike the first one it was
  not the plan. The instruction was to freeze two payloads; I froze neither, because the source
  audit turned up something the instruction had not anticipated - the mechanism Ch 5 §5.4
  describes is *complete without* the message I had been asked to specify. Logs are exchanged,
  each side recomputes locally, and the book says outright that "the cryptography, and not human
  judgement, decides". A transmitted verdict is the other side's assertion about its own conduct,
  which is precisely what an unforgeable local recomputation exists to make unnecessary.
  What made the finding trustworthy was that three independent lines agreed: the Ch 5 prose, the
  Ch 7 Replay Viewer placement of `Verified OK`/`TAMPERED` over a *persisted file*, and Figure 6
  drawing four arrows and no fifth. One of those alone would have been an argument; three
  converging is evidence. The instruction had an explicit escape hatch - report an inventory
  contradiction and stop before touching the architecture - and using it was clearly right, since
  the alternative was to delete a family from a count that appears across half the documentation
  on my own authority.
- **Stage 4E-R10-R1** then had to resolve it, and the real work was refusing the tidy answer. The
  tidy answer is "there is no FinalAudit, delete it, nine families, done" - and it is wrong,
  because it quietly loses a source requirement. The audit only works if the material reaches the
  peer, and I had been assuming a `FinalAudit` message would carry it. Remove the message and the
  obligation does not disappear; it becomes *visible*, and it turns out nothing in the project was
  carrying it. The sealed record has eight members; Reveal discloses two of them and
  `FinalNonceReveal` one more; the peer still cannot rebuild the record. That gap had been hiding
  behind a family that should not have existed.
  So the correction is three-way, not a deletion: an implemented message, a source-required
  obligation that is *not* a message, and a local vocabulary. Writing it that way also forced a
  new blocker into the open - the interchange shape of the audit material - which I deliberately
  did not solve, because inventing bytes for it in the same stage that discovered it is how the
  first mistake happened.
  Two smaller disciplines. I kept writing "the source does not **require** a verdict message"
  rather than "forbids", because the difference decides whether a future stage may add one. And I
  corrected my own R10 wording that said the peer "learns the verdict through ResultAgreement" -
  the supported claim is only that a completed audit is a *precondition to* result agreement.
  Overstating a relationship is the same failure as inventing a field, just harder to notice.
- **Stage 4E-R10-R2** was the third stage in this sequence to produce nothing, and the
  discipline that mattered was refusing the *symmetrical* answer. I had just removed `FinalAudit`
  from the inventory on positive evidence, and `MoveValidation` looked like the same shape - no
  Figure 6 arrow, no payload anywhere, a reference snippet that does something else. The tempting
  move was to declare a second inventory contradiction and collect the matching result.
  It would have been wrong, and the reason is worth keeping. For `FinalAudit` I could show the
  audit mechanism is *complete without* the message: logs are exchanged, each side recomputes
  locally, the book says the cryptography decides. For `MoveValidation` the source says the
  opposite kind of thing - App E puts the rejection act **on the opponent**. I could not show the
  peer does nothing, so I had no basis for claiming over-classification. Two findings that look
  alike from a distance can need opposite verdicts, and "this resembles the last case" is not
  evidence. So the stage returned `BLOCKED-BY-EXISTENCE-EVIDENCE` and asked for a decision.
- **Stage 4E-R10-R3** received that decision, and the interesting part is what it did *not* let me
  do. With the mechanism chosen - transport response, not a message family - the obvious next move
  was to freeze the response: a `bool`, one meaning, done. I wrote the candidate down and then did
  not freeze it, because `API_BOUNDARIES.md` says in its own header that concrete operation
  signatures are deferred to Stage 2B-2C, and both peer ports are declared **async** with a generic
  "protocol response" return. A bare `bool` on an async port whose contract does not exist yet
  cannot preserve the four-way separation I had just written down in the same stage - delivery,
  authentication, protocol order, legality. It would collapse them by accident, which is exactly
  the failure the FastMCP example demonstrates: its `accepted` is `verify_signature(...)`, an
  authentication result wearing the word that everyone reads as legality.
  So the stage closes PARTIAL on purpose, and the tracking says so rather than rounding up. The
  useful realisation is that two separate blockers - this one and the audit-material exchange - are
  now both waiting on the *same* missing thing: the peer operation contract. That is not a
  coincidence to note in passing, it is the shape of the next stage, and it is why R11 is scoped
  around the operation boundary rather than around either blocker individually.
- **Stage 4E-R11** finally cleared a blocker that three earlier stages had circled, and the
  thing that unlocked it was noticing a conflation I had been making myself. R10-R3 left the
  move-rejection shape blocked because "both peer ports are **async**", and I had treated that as
  meaning there is no request/response contract to hang a result on. That is a category error:
  `async` describes how the I/O is executed, not whether a call has a reply. The committed
  `CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` had already said so in plain words - outgoing peer calls are *"per
  request, async, bounded… never fire-and-forget for state-changing calls"* - and I had read that
  document before without connecting it. The blocker was partly mine.
  Once request/response was stated explicitly, the `bool` became safe for a reason worth keeping:
  it is not safe because a bool is simple, it is safe because **every other failure already has an
  owner**. `E-TRANSPORT`, `E-PROTO-MALFORMED`, `E-AUTH-FAILURE`, `E-PROTO-STALE` each raise at
  their own layer, so nothing else can arrive dressed as `False`. The danger a bare bool poses is
  proportional to how many failure modes can collapse into it, and that number was already zero -
  I just had not written it down. The FastMCP example remains the cautionary case: its `accepted`
  is `verify_signature(...)`, an authentication result wearing the word everyone reads as legality.
  The audit blocker did not close, and the useful outcome there was making it *smaller* rather
  than pretending. It went from "we do not know the interchange representation" to one reviewable
  question: the finalized log document is classified **LOCAL-ONLY**, and its ack/reveal nesting is
  still REVIEW-REQUIRED, so promoting it to a shared payload is a decision someone has to take on
  the record. I deliberately did not take it, and deliberately did not edit `LOG_CONTRACT.md` to
  make my own life easier - reclassifying a locked document as a side effect of unblocking myself
  is precisely the move this whole sequence of stages exists to prevent.
  One structural note for later. Naming a blocker precisely is what makes it solvable: "blocked by
  interoperability shape" invited a redesign, while "blocked by log artifact shape" invites one
  yes/no question. Vague blockers grow; named ones get closed.
- **Stage 4E-R11-R1** closed the last integration blocker, and the part worth recording is a
  contradiction I had to resolve to finish a proof the instruction demanded. The stage required a
  mechanical demonstration that a receiver can rebuild every sealed record from what the sender
  discloses. Working through it, `state` stopped the proof: `FIELD_MATRIX` lists the sealed record
  as a Required per-turn log row, while `LOG_CONTRACT` §B says the hashed payload is "a distinct
  object from the persistent entry" and the illustrative example omits `state` from a reveal
  entry. Read the second way, `state` is never disclosed - and the receiver cannot derive
  `state.self_pos` under partial observation, so independent verification would be impossible.
  The resolution was to notice the two statements are about different things: the *bytes* are
  derived and never stored; the *members* are persisted. That reading makes both contracts true
  and adds no field. What I want to keep is the discipline of hitting the contradiction at all -
  it only surfaced because the instruction demanded a mechanical proof rather than an assurance.
  A prose claim that "the log carries what audit needs" would have sailed past it.
- The **CLOSE-time payload-core guard** then caught something in my own work from the previous
  stage. I had classified `by_role` as local artifact metadata and written that it "**may**
  appear" - which, without saying *where*, reads as optional wire content. And my lifecycle
  sentence excluded only local-*derived* annotations, saying nothing about local *metadata*. So
  the payload boundary was not deterministic: two readers could disagree about whether `by_role`
  and `schema_version` belong in a `submit_audit` message. That is exactly the class of ambiguity
  that produces two implementations which each believe they are compliant.
  The fix was small - state that both categories are outside the payload, and that existing local
  metadata rules do not leak into wire semantics - but the lesson is about the word "may". In an
  interoperability contract, optionality is a decision, not a hedge. Every "may" should either
  name the context that makes it deterministic or become a "must"/"must not".
  I also narrowed my own over-broad claim that "no semantic fact is represented twice". It is
  false in a useful way: the revealed move and hint legitimately appear both as historical Reveal
  evidence and as sealed-record audit input, with values expected to agree - and being able to
  compare them is the point. The accurate statement is that no *field* is duplicated within a
  single event. Tidy-sounding absolutes are worth re-reading; this one would have justified
  deleting evidence a future auditor needs.
