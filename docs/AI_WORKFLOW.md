# AI Workflow - group MaRs-777

> **Status: DRAFT.**

## Roles

- The **human** receives a prompt from the supervising reviewer.
- **Claude Code** performs repository and terminal work inside a single repository.
- Claude returns an **evidence report** (exact commands + results).
- Work is **reviewed** before any commit or push.

## Principles

- No implementation before an approved plan.
- No commit/push without explicit instruction.
- Exact command/result reporting; explicit statement of what was not verified.
- Stage prompt texts (e.g., Stage 0A through Stage 0C) may be recorded or
  referenced in `docs/PROMPTS.md` **without** including any secrets.
- Stage 0C established the two private GitHub remotes (owner mohammedawad99) and
  the `origin` configuration (**SSH** transport); commits and pushes happen only
  under explicit reviewer approval, and no authentication output or secret is
  ever recorded here.
- **Stage 1-SYNC** adopted the reviewed **common** Stage-1 specification baseline by
  **one-way synchronization** from the Police repository's locked commit
  `691280dc3219452eeff462c997714fd5bcbd9e55` (documentation only). The specification
  stages 1A–1D.1 were executed and reviewed **in the Police repository**; this
  repository did **not** perform that extraction and does not claim to have. The two
  repositories keep separate Git history, package namespaces (`mars777_thief` here),
  runtime state, and future strategy. See `SOURCES.md` and `DECISIONS.md` D15.
- **Phase 2 (Stages 2A → 2-CLOSE)** froze the architecture and authored all seven PRDs.
  Stage 2-CLOSE resolved the two final cross-contract issues **without changing any locked
  contract**: the series convention is negotiated protocol metadata (not a declaration field)
  and the declared MCP endpoint is a stable group-level ingress. **PRD-01…07 are
  APPROVED — PHASE 2 LOCKED; implementation has NOT started.**
- **Phase 3 (Stage 3A →)** is the first implementation phase. Stage 3A was driven
  **tests-first**: every domain test was written and observed failing in both repositories
  before any production module existed. It delivers only the deterministic, role-neutral
  foundation - grid configuration, coordinates, board geometry with blocked cells, the
  five-token move set, movement legality and safe move application. The project grid
  minimum is enforced by `GridConfig`, deliberately **not** by the policy-free `Board`
  geometry, per the frozen domain-layer boundary. **PRD-01…07 remain APPROVED — PHASE 2
  LOCKED**; the deterministic core is **not** complete and no protocol, networking,
  cryptography, strategy, GUI or reporting code exists.
- **Stage 3B** completed the deterministic game-rule layer tests-first: barriers,
  capture, terminal/survival, scoring and bounded scent physics. Two supervising
  corrections were applied. **JDEC-015** records a source *gap* — Appendix F fixes two
  independent MINIMUM-35 step limits but Ch 3 Table 2 defines no outcome when the
  ceiling precedes the survival threshold, so `survival_threshold <= max_moves` became
  an admissibility condition instead of an invented terminal. **C-10** records a source
  *contradiction* — Ch 4 §4.3 defines tau in [0, 0.9] yet writes the update with a lower
  clamp only, so the state domain wins and the recurrence saturates. Registers are now
  **JDEC-001…015** and **C-01…C-10**; every authoritative count is unchanged. Turn
  orchestration, protocol, networking, cryptography, strategy, GUI and reporting remain
  **not implemented**; PRD-01 stays **IN PROGRESS** and PRD-02…07 **NOT STARTED**.
- **Stage 3C** opened the application layer with the **local** turn-execution step,
  tests-first. Supervising review accepted it except for one state-ownership defect:
  `LocalTruth` carried a `barriers_placed` counter that duplicated the public board's
  barrier facts and could drift from them, and it was police-only state sitting in a
  role-neutral object. **Stage 3C-FIX1** removed it; remaining budget is derived from
  `max_barriers - len(board.blocked)`, and `STATE_OWNERSHIP.md` anti-duplication rule 2
  is satisfied. No architecture document was changed. **PRD-02 is now IN PROGRESS**
  for this one slice; the state machine, orchestrator, ports, FastMCP, networking and
  cryptography remain **not implemented**, and PRD-03…07 stay **NOT STARTED**.
- **Stage 4A** added the local protocol phase machine, tests-first, pinning the frozen
  graph literally rather than against the implementation: an exhaustive 324-pair sweep
  makes a hidden or missing edge impossible. Supervising review then found a genuine
  contradiction inside the frozen table itself - TECHNICAL_LOSS was absorbing although
  the same table makes "technical loss" an entry condition of SUBGAME_COMPLETE, tells
  the phase to "proceed per series rules", and excludes it from rule R5. **Stage
  4A-FIX1** added the single edge `TECHNICAL_LOSS -> SUBGAME_COMPLETE` and recorded the
  reasoning in `STATE_MACHINE.md` §4 as an implementation-discovered architecture
  correction - not a lecturer rule, not a source conflict, no register increment.
  Primary source agrees: Ch 3 Table 2 lists technical loss as a **sub-game** end event
  scored 0/0 beside capture and survival. TAMPERED keeps its severe, non-repairable
  status. PRD-06 remains **NOT STARTED** despite the crypto-named phases.
- **Stage 4B** added transition evidence, tests-first. The instructive part was what
  the stage did **not** build. The prompt allowed typed transition signals, but an
  audit of every source and architecture document found **no frozen transition-signal
  vocabulary** - `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md`'s 15 numbered events are protocol-timeline
  entries, not state-machine signals - so inventing a 31-value event enum would have
  created a second representation of a graph that already exists once. The target
  phase stayed the typed request. Likewise, the per-state Evidence column names
  artifacts, hashes and log entries, but event 10 fixes the *state machine's* share as
  literally "phase transition" with persistence and hashing both "—", so evidence is
  the two phases and nothing else. Supervising review then raised two close-critical
  points. **Stage 4B-FIX1** answered the first by making evidence **valid by
  construction**: R7 records a *successful* transition and R1/R5 forbid the skips, so
  a value naming a non-edge could never be truthful. Validation reuses `_ALLOWED`
  directly - one dict literal, one enum class in the module. That deleted the old
  negative test's subject, and the honest fix was to move the corruption boundary
  forward to the constructor and **add** replay negatives (duplicated record,
  out-of-position record) rather than relax the constructor to keep an obsolete test
  alive. The second point was a reported contradiction between a "153-line" file and
  "0 files over 150"; it resolved as a **units error in the report** - 153 was the
  cross-repo semantic-diff count, physical LOC was 150 - and a repository-wide sweep
  of all 48 `*.py` files per repo proved max 150 and 0 over. Throughout, the honest
  claim was kept narrow: structural validity is not authenticity, and phase replay is
  not game replay. PRD-06 and PRD-07 remain **NOT STARTED**.
- **Stage 4C** added the local orchestrator, tests-first, and its lesson was about
  *authority* rather than code. The ownership audit had to reconcile two frozen
  documents that disagree: `MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md` lists "turn cursor, sub-game
  index" as `app.orchestrator` state, while `STATE_OWNERSHIP.md` - the authority
  for mutable-state ownership - puts turn/step under `domain.truth`. The
  already-approved D17 precedent settled it, so no turn cursor was stored and no
  blocker was raised. The same audit found that the table *also* assigns the
  **recorded score** to the orchestrator; that responsibility was reported and
  **deferred**, not silently dropped and not quietly implemented, because its
  input is a terminal `Outcome` the local agent cannot yet know. Role alternation
  was likewise refused: PRD02-FR-011 makes it a negotiated `SeriesLauncher`
  convention with no silent default, so nothing was derived from an odd/even
  index. The real defect surfaced at review. Stage 4C had implemented the series
  length as a floor (`>= 6`) on the strength of one sentence in
  `CONFIG_CONTRACT.md` - "6 (or the agreed higher)" - without checking it against
  Appendix F's own status table, which lists `num_games` under **FIXED** and
  defines FIXED as "binding, unchangeable; deviation disqualifies". **Stage
  4C-FIX1** corrected the code to exact equality and, because the stale wording
  really was in the committed tree (in `CONFIG_CONTRACT.md` and the C-05 impact
  cell), narrowed those two sentences to the meaning App F and C-05 had already
  locked - no new JDEC, conflict or requirement. The lesson is the authority
  hierarchy the project already had: a derived contract sentence never outranks
  the Appendix-F status it is derived from. The error was caught before commit,
  and this record keeps it rather than hiding it.
- **Stage 4D** was authorized to build the application port contracts and instead
  stopped before writing a single line, which is the outcome the process is for.
  Three internal contradictions made a truthful implementation impossible:
  `API_BOUNDARIES.md` says in its own header "**No Python signatures are fixed
  here**", and a repository-wide search of every architecture and PRD document
  found no `def`, no `Protocol` and no return annotation - so every method name
  would have been invented; the `app.ports` row allowed **stdlib typing only**
  while the same architecture defines `GameRulesPort` over board/action/config and
  `ScoringPort` over outcome to per-role scores, leaving those ports
  unrepresentable in the module assigned to them; and `PLAN.md` still claimed 18
  ports where the frozen table has 20. The tempting move was to ship a thin
  `ClockPort` with a `monotonic() -> float`, since that is the one port whose input
  is "—" and whose headline output is a stdlib scalar. It was refused: the method
  name is not frozen, and the row's own Returns column also lists deadlines and
  timers whose machinery `CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` assigns to the Watchdog, the
  Deadline timers and the executor. Shipping a third of a port under its full name
  would have been an overclaim. **Stage 4D-R1** repaired the architecture instead
  of the symptom, changing exactly one cell of one module row - dependency
  inversion is aimed at concrete adapters, not at the domain model, and `app`
  already imports `domain` - and recorded that any future Python signature is a
  **PROJECT-CONTRACT**, never source- or reference-mandated. The analysis also
  found that not every row named `*Port` needs a Protocol: wrapping a pure
  deterministic domain function the orchestrator may already call directly adds
  indirection without substitutability. The blocked stage is kept in the record as
  evidence, not erased.
- **Stage 4E** stopped before code for the second time in a row, and the reconciliation
  that followed is the more interesting half. The stage was scoped to build internal
  semantic peer-message values in `protocol.messages`, and the audit found the home
  itself was wrong: that row is a **wire** boundary, while `CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` has
  the server "validate, convert to an **event**, and submit it to the executor queue" -
  and the Turn Executor is `app`. Since `app` may never import `protocol`, a semantic
  value the executor consumes simply cannot live there. That turned a naming debate
  into a proof. The second blocker looked worse: PRD02-FR-044 required every inbound
  message to carry `(sub_game, step, phase)`, yet nothing anywhere defines step
  numbering, the pre-turn value, or what `phase` even denotes. The temptation was a
  `step=0` sentinel. Instead the answer came from inside PRD-02: **FR-063**, the
  requirement that actually names the "cursor guard" and traces to R8 exactly as
  FR-044 does, lists only **sub-game and step**, while the phase rejection is
  **FR-062** under **STATE-003** - a receiver-side check against the receiver's own
  machine. A state-machine walk confirmed it: turns are lockstep, so a transmitted
  phase is either constant per message family (redundant) or not independently
  computable (peers sit in different phases at the same moment). Narrowing FR-044
  dissolved the phase-dependency blocker for free, because nothing needs to transmit a
  phase at all - and the single `ProtocolPhase` stayed exactly where it was. The audit
  also caught an omission in the project's own earlier planning: the peer-visible
  family count is **10**, not 9; Event 8 "Move validation" transmits accept/reject and
  had been dropped. Both the blocked stage and the miscount are kept in the record.
- **Stage 4F** audited nine value representations and stopped before code again, this
  time on a subtler problem: two representations were genuinely ready, but there was
  nowhere legal to put them. A SHA-256 digest is produced by `protocol.commitment` and
  `protocol.config_lock` and carried by `app.peer_messages`, and no module in the frozen
  table was reachable by all three. The easy answers were both wrong - duplicating the
  validator per layer would have created the semantic drift the anti-duplication rule
  exists to prevent, and a `types.py` would have been the junk drawer the stage brief
  explicitly forbade. **Stage 4F-R1** fixed it by first correcting the project's own
  analysis: `infra.logger`, `infra.artifacts` and `infra.reporter` had been listed as
  consumers, but they are **mappers** - they serialize whatever structured record they
  are handed, and that record already reaches them through `app.ports`. With the real
  consumer set down to three, one inner contract module plus two narrow type-reference
  dependencies sufficed, reusing the pattern Stage 4E-R1 had already established. Two
  representation defects surfaced in the same review. The digest had been called
  ready while its case policy was called unresolved - a contradiction in one report;
  resolving it meant separating **algorithm** (SOURCE), **encoding** (project-locked
  hex), **length** (entailed by SHA-256) and **case** (genuinely free), then adopting
  lowercase as a labelled PROJECT-CONTRACT that **rejects** uppercase rather than
  silently rewriting it. And `RESULT_CONTRACT.md` turned out to define
  `mutual_agreement` as a bool in its field table, scoring rule and example while its
  approval-core prose treated it as an object whose `.sha256` duplicated the separate
  `result_sha256` - the prose was the stale side, and correcting it kept the locked
  11-field result count intact. Seven representations remain deferred rather than
  guessed.
