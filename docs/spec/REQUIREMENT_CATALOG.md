# Requirement Catalog — group MaRs-777

**Status: REVIEWED — Stage 1B supervising review PASS. Approved specification
baseline (input to Stage 1C). Implementation remains prohibited (NOT STARTED); the
four JSON contracts were reviewed and LOCKED (Stage 1C/1D/1D.1). Modality counts
were approved: MUST 76, MUST NOT 9, SHOULD 4, MAY 2 = 91.**

Source-grounded requirements extracted from the **entire** book v3.0.0 (not only
Appendices E/F). One independently-testable requirement per ID. Modality per
`AUTHORITY_RULES.md` (MUST/MUST NOT/SHOULD/MAY/INFORMATIONAL). Scope: BOTH /
POLICE / THIEF / LEAGUE / SUBMISSION. Sanctions are recorded **only** where the
book states one. Verification describes how we can later prove compliance and
does not change the requirement. Citation format: `PDF p.X / book p.Y`. This
repo is **THIEF**; THIEF-scoped rows are primary, BOTH rows apply equally.
**POLICE-scoped rows are retained deliberately** — this agent must still know the
opponent's protocol obligations, the shared scoring/interoperability rules, and the
replay/reporting duties it is audited against. Scope labels denote the **game role**
a requirement binds, not which repository "owns" the text.

Column key: **Mod** = modality · **E** = Appendix E entry · **F** = Appendix F
ref · **Conf** = conflict id in `CONFLICT_REGISTER.md` (— = none). "Verify" and
"Evidence" are planned (Stage 1A does not implement).

## Catalog summary (statistics — not a completeness proof by themselves)

- **Total requirements: 91** across 18 domains (verified by row count; no duplicate IDs).
- **By modality (exact, Stage 1B):** **MUST 76 · MUST NOT 9 · SHOULD 4 (LLM-001, CRYPTO-010, PERF-003, DOC-003) · MAY 2 (STRAT-003, LLM-005)** = 91. INFORMATIONAL captured separately in `PAGE_COVERAGE.md`.
- **By scope:** BOTH dominates; POLICE ≈ 7; LEAGUE ≈ 7; SUBMISSION ≈ 9.
- **Appendix E coverage:** all 55 E-entries referenced by ≥1 catalog ID (see `APPENDIX_E_CROSSWALK.md`).
- **Conflicts flagged:** C-01, C-02, C-05, C-06 (see `CONFLICT_REGISTER.md`).
- Counts are indicative; completeness rests on the page-coverage ledger and the Appendix E/F crosswalks, not on these totals.
