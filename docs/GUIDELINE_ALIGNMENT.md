# Guideline alignment — group MaRs-777 (THIEF)

**Status: CURRENT.** Written at Stage 9A-1A against the lecturer's own document,
read directly. Nothing here is reconstructed from memory or from a summary.

## 1. The source

| Title | *Guidelines for Writing Professional Software at the Highest Level of Excellence* (הנחיות לכתיבת תוכנה מקצועית ברמת הצטיינות יתרה) |

The PDF is an **external course reference**. It is held outside both
repositories, read-only, and is deliberately **not committed** — this file
records its identity and section numbers instead, which is enough for anyone to
re-derive every verdict below from their own copy.

Section numbers below are the document's own (`§2.1` = README, `§3.2` = the
150-line rule, and so on). The Hebrew original renders them right-to-left as
`1.2`, `2.3`; they are written here in the conventional order.

## 2. The lecturer's own qualification (§19)

> Not every clause must be implemented in full; the more criteria are met, the
> higher the quality assessment. Focus on depth, professionalism, and
> demonstrated engineering capability.

§19 is recorded because it is real, and it is **not** used below to excuse a
single binding requirement of the project book. Where a clause is marked
`JUSTIFIED_NA`, the reason is structural — the project genuinely has no such
surface — never "§19 says we may skip it".

§19 also states that the assessment itself may be performed with AI agents.
Every claim in this document is therefore written to be **mechanically
checkable**: file paths, counts and commands, not adjectives.

## 3. Alignment matrix

Status vocabulary: **PASS** · **PARTIAL** · **GAP** · **JUSTIFIED_NA**.

| § | Requirement (summarised) | Status | Evidence | Closure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | `README.md` as a full user manual: install, usage, examples, configuration, contribution, license & credits | **PARTIAL** | `README.md` — all sections present; **screenshots absent** because there is no GUI to photograph | GUI slice, then Stage 9C |
| 2.2 | `docs/` with `PRD.md`, `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md` | **PASS** | `docs/PRD.md` (index + goals), `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TODO.md` | — |
| 2.3 | A dedicated PRD per algorithm / central mechanism | **PASS** | `docs/prd/PRD-01…07` — game logic, FastMCP, strategy, language & scent, public network, security & cryptography, reporting/GUI/replay | — |
| 2.4 | Recommended tree (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `config/`, `data/`, `results/`, `assets/`, `notebooks/`, `.env.example`) | **PARTIAL** | `src/ tests/ docs/ config/ artifacts/ .env.example` present, and **`sdk/` and `shared/version.py` added at Stage 9A-1B1**; still no `shared/gatekeeper.py`, `data/`, `results/`, `assets/`, `notebooks/` | §5.1 row below; `notebooks/`+`results/` at Stage 9B |
| 2.5 | Mandatory workflow PRD → PLAN → TODO → per-mechanism PRD → approval → implement | **PASS** | `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md`; every stage in `docs/PLAN.md` names its approval | — |
| 3.1 | Modular project structure, clear separation of concerns | **PASS** | hexagonal layout `domain/ app/ protocol/ transport/ infra/`, enforced by `docs/architecture/DEPENDENCY_RULES.md` and a framework-confinement test | — |
| 3.2 | **≤ 150 code lines per file** (blank and comment lines excluded); split, never compress | **PARTIAL** | `src/`: **0 / 234** files over the limit. `tests/`: **12** files over it (largest 435 code lines) | Stage 9A-1B split |
| 3.3 | Docstrings on every module/class/function; comments explain *why* | **PASS** | every `src/**/*.py` module opens with a rationale docstring; ruff `D`-style discipline is visible throughout | — |
| 4.1 | **SDK layer** — one public entry point for all consumers; no business logic in CLI/GUI/controllers | **PASS** | `mars777_thief/sdk` — `AgentSdk` with five operations, each a forwarding call to the composition module that owns the work. Every operator entrypoint now reaches nothing but the standard library and `.sdk`, proven by a structural test; a second test proves the facade names no business authority and no framework; an out-of-process consumer test proves the surface is usable from the installed distribution alone | — (extended when GUI and replay exist) |
| 4.2 | OOP, DRY, extract shared logic, mixin discipline | **PASS** | shared authorities are extracted, not copied (e.g. `app/kit_payload.py`, `transport/call_arguments.py`); no duplicated function body found across the package | — |
| 5.1 | **Central API Gatekeeper** — every external call through it; rate limits, queue, retries, monitoring | **GAP** (with real partial control) | dedicated authorities exist per surface — `transport/session_deadline.py` (deadline), `startup_budget.py` (narrow retry), `app/network_failure_policy.py` (explicit no-retry rule), `app/kit_delivery.py` (idempotency) — but there is **no single component** enforcing limits and logging every outbound call | Stage 9A-1C; see §4 for what must **not** be wrapped |
| 5.2 | Rate limits from configuration, never hardcoded | **PARTIAL** | `RateLimiterTerms` (requests/min, concurrency, backoff, max retries, queue depth) is **negotiated and cryptographically locked** at Step-0 and validated against Appendix F floors — so nothing is hardcoded — but there is **no local versioned `config/rate_limits.json`**, and the terms are **not enforced at call time** | Stage 9A-1C |
| 5.3 | Overflow queued (FIFO, bounded, backpressure), never dropped | **GAP** | `queue_depth` is negotiated and validated; no queue implementation consumes it | Stage 9A-1C |
| 6.1 | TDD red-green-refactor; every module has a test file; **test files also obey the 150-line rule** | **PARTIAL** | tests-first is the recorded method for every implementation stage (`docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md`); 384 test files; **12 exceed 150 code lines** | Stage 9A-1B split |
| 6.2 | Coverage ≥ 85%, suite fails below the threshold | **PASS** | measured **100%**; gate `fail_under = 90` in `pyproject.toml` and in CI — both above the 85% floor | — |
| 6.3 | Edge cases identified, documented, defensive programming, graceful degradation | **PASS** | `docs/architecture/ERROR_MODEL.md`; frozen error identities; dedicated edge suites (`tests/kit_series/test_kit_edges.py`, `tests/boot/test_runtime_edges.py`) | — |
| 6.4 | Expected test results documented; automated pass/fail reports; run logs kept | **PARTIAL** | CI runs the full suite on every push and its result is public per commit; no stored expected-result report artifact | Stage 9C |
| 7.1 | Ruff — zero violations | **PASS** | `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format --check .` are CI gates | — |
| 7.2 | No hardcoded configurable values | **PASS** | game parameters come from `NegotiatedConfig`; project constants live in dedicated modules; secrets come only from the environment (`infra/settings.py`) | — |
| 7.3 | Versioned configuration files, `.env` git-ignored, `.env.example` committed | **PARTIAL** | `.env.example` added at this stage; `.gitignore` covers `.env`, `.env.*`, `token.json`, `client_secret*.json`; **`config/` holds no versioned JSON** because the binding configuration is negotiated with the peer, not shipped | Stage 9A-1C |
| 7.4 | No secrets in the project; environment variables only; key rotation and least privilege | **PASS** | `AuthSecret` cannot be printed (`repr`/`str` → `<withheld>`); the tunnel credential is never read by this project at all; `SECURITY.md`; secret scan clean | — |
| 8.1 | **Explicit version tracking** for code, configuration and rate limits, starting at `1.00`, validated at boot | **PARTIAL** | **Code version: PASS.** `shared/version.py` holds the one authority at the guideline's initial value, rendered `1.00` for the guideline and `1.0` for packaging from a single stored value; `pyproject.toml`, `__version__` and the installed distribution metadata are held to it by test, and a mismatch refuses the process at facade construction. **Configuration version: PASS** — `NegotiatedConfig.schema_version` is carried in the hashed projection and covered by the mutual `config_sha256` comparison, so a peer proposing a different schema version cannot lock a configuration with us. **Still missing: `rate_limits.version`**, which needs the local versioned rate-limit configuration file | Stage 9A-1C |
| 8.2 | Clear commit history, feature branches, PR review, tags for major versions | **PARTIAL** | 81 commits, one purpose each, no force-push, no rewritten history; work is supervised stage-by-stage on `main` rather than through PRs; **no tag yet** — the submission tag is deliberately deferred to Stage 9C | Stage 9C |
| 8.3 | **Prompt book** — every significant prompt, its context and goal, outputs, iterations, lessons | **PASS** | `docs/PROMPTS.md` (stage register, backfilled through 9A-0) + `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md` (method, corrections, lessons) | — |
| 8.4 | **uv mandatory**; no `pip`, no bare `python -m` in code, scripts, CI or documentation | **PASS** | `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` committed; CI installs with `uv sync --frozen` and runs every tool through `uv run`; all documented commands are `uv run …` | — |
| 9.1 | Systematic parameter study / sensitivity analysis | **GAP** | not started; deliberately deferred so that no learning curve is fabricated | Stage 9B |
| 9.2 | Results-analysis notebook | **GAP** | no `notebooks/` | Stage 9B |
| 9.3 | Result visualisation (bar/line/scatter/heatmap/box) | **GAP** | no generated charts | Stage 9B |
| 10 | UI/UX quality criteria, Nielsen heuristics, screenshots of every screen | **GAP** | no GUI exists | GUI slice |
| 11 | Cost analysis (token counts, cost per model, budget monitoring) | **PARTIAL** | `docs/COSTS.md` records **measured** resource use; the token table is structurally `0` because the shipped hint path is a deterministic template provider with no model and no network | — (revisit only if an LLM path is ever enabled) |
| 12 | Extension points, plugin-style interfaces, maintainability | **PASS** | a **21-port register** in `docs/architecture/API_BOUNDARIES.md`, of which **18** are declared in `src/` as `Protocol` classes — `StrategyPort`, `PeerTransportPort`, `ArtifactStorePort`, `CommitmentPort`, `NonceSourcePort`, `TimestampPort`, `HintPort`, `HintCatalogue`, `PublicIngressPort`, `ConfigDigestPort`, `ConfigLockAuthPort`, `ResultDigestPort`, `TokenAccountingPort`, `PeerOperations`, `AuthProvider`, `HostResolver`, `JsonFetcher`, `ScentBeliefSource`. Every one has a production adapter and a test double, so a consumer can be replaced without touching the domain | — |
| 13 | ISO/IEC 25010 product-quality characteristics | **PASS** (mapped) | §5 of this document | — |
| 14 | Package organisation: `pyproject.toml` with name/version/description/author/license/deps; `__init__.py` everywhere with `__version__`; relative imports only | **PASS** | all metadata present and current; `__version__` renders the authority rather than holding a literal; `__all__` declared in `__init__.py` and in `sdk/__init__.py`; every import in `src/` is relative or by package name | — |
| 15 | Concurrency: right tool for I/O vs CPU, thread safety, resource cleanup | **PASS** | `docs/architecture/CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` — single-threaded asyncio for an I/O-bound protocol, one owner per mutable structure, deterministic ordering, explicit teardown proven by test | — |
| 16 | Building-block design: declared input / output / setup data, single responsibility, dependency injection | **PASS** | every adapter is constructed with its collaborators; ports are the declared interfaces; no module reaches for a global | — |
| 17 | Final submission checklist | **PARTIAL** | `docs/SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` is current and per-row evidenced; several rows are legitimately still `PENDING` | Stage 9C |
| 20 | Detailed appendix (restates 2–17 as a checklist) | — | covered by the rows above | — |

## 4. §5.1 — what a Gatekeeper may and may not wrap

Recorded because a naïve reading of §5.1 would **break** this project.

| External surface | Timeout | Retry | Rate limit | Queue | Idempotency | Gatekeeper-safe? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Peer gameplay calls (FastMCP `receive_turn`, `submit_audit`, `receive_control`) | locked `NegotiatedConfig` value, applied per request by `transport/session_deadline.py` | **must stay forbidden** | negotiated floors apply | **must stay forbidden** | commitment-keyed dedupe in `app/kit_delivery.py` | **NO** — a generic retry re-sends a turn the peer already applied, which Appendix E rule 35 classifies as a protocol violation, and a queue would silently break lockstep ordering |
| Peer pre-game (`negotiate` / Step-0) | bounded startup budget | **narrow, already implemented** — only "peer not listening yet", never a refusal | negotiated floors apply | n/a | n/a | partial — the existing `startup_budget.py` is the correct authority |
| Tunnel provider API (`infra/ngrok_ingress.py`, `ingress_release.py`) | 8 s / httpx `ReadTimeout` | safe | **missing** | **missing** | safe | **YES** — this is the one surface a real Gatekeeper should own today |
| Gmail / reporting | — | — | — | — | — | **YES**, when it exists — §5.1's motivating case (HTTP 429 back-off) |
| LLM provider | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | **JUSTIFIED_NA** — the shipped hint policy is a deterministic template catalogue: no provider, no network, no tokens |

The control goal of §5.1 is therefore **partly met by stronger, protocol-specific
authorities** and **unmet for provider APIs**. The closure is a Gatekeeper that
owns provider calls, not one that wraps gameplay.

## 5. ISO/IEC 25010 mapping (§13)

| Characteristic | How this project addresses it | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Functional suitability | every book requirement is catalogued and traced to code and tests | `docs/spec/REQUIREMENT_CATALOG.md` (91), `docs/REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md` |
| Performance efficiency | measured protocol overhead against the turn budget | `docs/COSTS.md`; gateway hop ≈ 7.8 ms against a 180 s budget |
| Compatibility | two envelope profiles; interoperability with a third-party pinned kit proven by live play | `docs/architecture/API_BOUNDARIES.md §8`, `docs/reference/KIT_PAIRING_HANDOFF.md` |
| Usability | CLI with one option per decision, explicit exit-status classification, operator runbook | `docs/reference/MATCH_RUNBOOK.md`; `README.md` |
| Reliability | deterministic engine, 100% covered, settlement signalled rather than inferred, proven teardown | CI; `docs/architecture/STATE_MACHINE.md` |
| Security | keyed Step-0 authentication, commitment/reveal integrity, unprintable secrets, threat model | `docs/architecture/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md` (15 threats), `SECURITY.md` |
| Maintainability | hexagonal layers, 12 ports, ≤150 code lines per source file, dependency rules enforced by test | `docs/architecture/DEPENDENCY_RULES.md`, `QUALITY_GATES.md` |
| Portability | `uv`-managed, Python pinned to 3.12, CI on Ubuntu **and** Windows, no absolute paths | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `pyproject.toml` |

## 6. Where this document must be updated

- when the test-file split lands (§3.2 / §6.1 rows);
- when a provider Gatekeeper lands (§5.1, §5.2, §5.3, §7.3);
- when the rate-limit configuration file gives §8.1 its third version row;
- when Stage 9B produces the parameter study, notebook and charts (§9.1–§9.3);
- when a GUI and its screenshots exist (§10, §2.1);
- at the submission freeze (§8.2 tag, §17).
