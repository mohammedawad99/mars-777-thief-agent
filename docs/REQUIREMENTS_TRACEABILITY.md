# Requirements Traceability Matrix - group MaRs-777

> **Status: REVIEWED — Stage-1 baseline LOCKED (supervising review PASS); rows extend in later stages.** Seeded foundation rows (F-0xx)
> retained; catalog requirements (Stage 1A extraction) added with catalog IDs.
> Stage 1A statuses are one of: **EXTRACTED**, **REVIEW REQUIRED**, **CONFLICT**,
> **NOT APPLICABLE**. Nothing is IMPLEMENTED or VERIFIED. Full details and
> citations live in `docs/spec/REQUIREMENT_CATALOG.md`; conflicts in
> `docs/CONFLICT_REGISTER.md` (**C-01…C-10**; C-10 added post-lock in
> Stage 3B-FIX2 — scent state bound vs additive update). "Component" = planned PRD/area.

**Reading the `Repository` (role-scope) column in this THIEF repository.** The value
is the **game role a requirement binds**, not an implementation assignment, and no row
is deleted on role grounds:

| Value | How this repository treats it |
|---|---|
| **Both** | Common obligation — **to be implemented by this repository** (and by the opponent). |
| **Thief** | This agent's own primary obligation — **to be implemented by this repository**. |
| **Police** | **Opponent-side obligation: validated/expected from the opponent**, and part of the common protocol this agent is audited against. Retained deliberately — **not implemented locally**. |
| **League / Submission** | **Common external protocol / delivery duty** (scoring, reporting, repos, Moodle) binding on the team as a whole. |

**No implementation status is claimed anywhere in this matrix** — every row remains
EXTRACTED / REVIEW REQUIRED / CONFLICT / NOT APPLICABLE. Nothing is IMPLEMENTED or
VERIFIED; implementation has not begun.

## Stage 1C — JSON contract references (specification-level, not implemented)

The JSON / crypto / reporting requirement families are now **CONTRACT-DEFINED** in
`docs/spec/json/` (no code). Statuses here remain specification-level
(CONTRACT-DEFINED / PROJECT-DECISION / REVIEW-REQUIRED) — **none is IMPLEMENTED or
runtime-VERIFIED**.

| Requirement family | Contract document(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| JSON-001..004 (four JSON docs, structure) | `json/{README,CONFIG,DECLARATION,LOG,RESULT}_CONTRACT.md`, `json/FIELD_MATRIX.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED |
| JSON-003 exact field names | `json/*_CONTRACT.md` + `json/PROJECT_CONTRACT_DECISIONS.md` | PROJECT-DECISION (some fields REVIEW-REQUIRED) |
| CRYPTO-001/002/003/008/009 (commit-reveal, canonical hash) | `json/LOG_CONTRACT.md`, `json/CANONICALIZATION_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED |
| CRYPTO-006 / PERF-002 (Step-0, token lock) | `json/DECLARATION_CONTRACT.md`, `json/SIGNATURE_AND_HASH_PROVENANCE.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED (Stage 1D.1 K1: **keyed authentication** `step0_auth`, HMAC-SHA256 default JDEC-013; primitive negotiable, requirement SOURCE) |
| REPLAY-002 (per-step verify) | `json/LOG_CONTRACT.md` §E | CONTRACT-DEFINED |
| REPORT-001/002, LEAGUE-002 (result report, mutual approval) | `json/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED; `result_sha256` = SHA-256-backed mutual acknowledgement (NDEC-006); missing/contradictory ⇒ 0 both (C-09); FastMCP + signed hardware mandatory (K3) |
| GIT-003 (`github_commit`) | `json/DECLARATION_CONTRACT.md`, `json/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED (SOURCE-EXPLICIT key) |
| GAME-006 scoring incl. technical_loss | `json/CONFIG_CONTRACT.md`, `json/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED (technical_loss provenance C-07 preserved) |

Cross-artifact invariants: `json/CROSS_ARTIFACT_INVARIANTS.md` (INV-01…INV-15).
Project decisions: `json/PROJECT_CONTRACT_DECISIONS.md` (**JDEC-001…JDEC-015**;
JDEC-015 added in Stage 3B-FIX1 — terminal threshold admissibility).

**Current baseline (after Stage 2A-R2):** field matrix **75** rows — declaration 16,
config 39, log 9, **result 11**. *(Stage 1 originally locked at 77 rows with result 13;
Stage-2A-R2 **JDEC-014** superseded the project-defined duplication of declaration-owned
static metadata in the result, so the current matrix is 75.)* Requirements remain **91**.

**Stage 1D (interoperability lock):** the contracts were independently audited and
locked for interoperable implementation. `json/STAGE_1D_AUDIT.md` (D1–D5),
`json/PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md`, `json/INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` (NDEC-001…007),
`json/INTEROPERABILITY_BLOCKERS.md` (**0 blocking**). Key resolutions: `verdict` =
`intent` (C-08); `state` PROJECT-LOCKED (JDEC-012); `config_sha256` non-self-referential;
`game_uid` SOURCE-EXPLICIT (kept).

**Stage 1D.1 (crypto & reporting corrections):** **K1** Step-0 and **K2** the config
signature exchange are **keyed authentication with a pre-supplied key** (SOURCE-
REQUIRED — Ch 5 p.55–56, App B p.128), **not** unkeyed SHA-256 digests and **not**
invented PKI; project default HMAC-SHA256 (JDEC-013, PROJECT-CONTRACT); envelopes
`step0_auth`/`config_auth` `{auth_alg,key_id,auth_tag}`, non-self-referential,
domain-separated (NDEC-005/007; INV-14/15). **K3** the emailed result is
**self-contained** — FastMCP endpoints + cryptographically-signed hardware
declarations (`hardware_auth`) are mandatory (INV-10/12/13). **K4** the
reporting-sanction conflict (Ch 9 per-side non-credit vs App E #35 game-void/0-both)
is recorded as **C-09** with the strictest 0-both rule (INV-11). `result_sha256`
mutual approval is SHA-256-backed acknowledgement (NDEC-006). **No key material** in
any artifact. Statuses remain specification-level; **nothing IMPLEMENTED**. Maps to
CRYPTO-006 (signed Step-0), CRYPTO-001/002 (commit-reveal), LEAGUE-002/REPORT-001/002
(reporting), PERF-002 (token lock).

**Completeness (updated Stage 1B):** every MUST / MUST NOT catalog requirement
appears above (exact modality of the full catalog: MUST 76, MUST NOT 9, SHOULD 4,
MAY 2 = 91). SHOULD/MAY rows are marked "Optional". **CONFLICT rows:** GAME-007
(C-01), STATE-004, STATE-005 (C-02). **REVIEW REQUIRED rows:** CRYPTO-009 (log
fields), JSON-003 (JSON field names). GAME-006 no longer CONFLICT (C-06 resolved;
C-07 technical_loss provenance noted). JSON-003 reclassified from CONFLICT (C-05
now closed) to REVIEW REQUIRED (field names → Stage 1C). All others **EXTRACTED**.
No row is IMPLEMENTED or VERIFIED.

**Phase-2 ownership (Stage 2-CLOSE):** all **91** requirements have exactly one primary
PRD owner — PRD-01 15 · PRD-02 11 · PRD-03 3 · PRD-04 10 · PRD-05 2 · PRD-06 14 ·
PRD-07 24 · EXTERNAL/SUBMISSION 12. Unmapped 0; duplicate primary 0. See
`prd/PRD_01_07_CROSSWALK.md`. **PRD-01…07 are APPROVED — PHASE 2 LOCKED; nothing is
IMPLEMENTED or VERIFIED.**

**Phase-3 progress (current):** PRD-01 and PRD-02 are **IN PROGRESS** — the
deterministic domain (Stages 3A/3B) and the local turn foundation (Stage 3C) are
implemented and tested, together with the local protocol phase machine
(Stage 4A, `STATE_MACHINE.md` graph enforcement only); PRD-03…07 remain
**NOT STARTED**.
