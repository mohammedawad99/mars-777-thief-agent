# Requirements Traceability Matrix - group MaRs-777

> **Status: REVIEWED — Stage-1 baseline LOCKED (supervising review PASS); rows extend in later stages.** Seeded foundation rows (F-0xx)
> retained; catalog requirements (Stage 1A extraction) added with catalog IDs.
> Stage 1A statuses are one of: **EXTRACTED**, **REVIEW REQUIRED**, **CONFLICT**,
> **NOT APPLICABLE**. Nothing is IMPLEMENTED or VERIFIED. Full details and
> citations live in `docs/spec/REQUIREMENT_CATALOG.md`; conflicts in
> `docs/CONFLICT_REGISTER.md` (**C-01…C-10**; C-10 added post-lock in
> Stage 3B-FIX2 — scent state bound vs additive update). "Component" = planned PRD/area.

**Reading the `Repository` (role-scope) column in this THIEF repository.** The value
is the **game role a requirement binds**, not an implementation assignment, and no row
is deleted on role grounds:

| Value | How this repository treats it |
|---|---|
| **Both** | Common obligation — **to be implemented by this repository** (and by the opponent). |
| **Thief** | This agent's own primary obligation — **to be implemented by this repository**. |
| **Police** | **Opponent-side obligation: validated/expected from the opponent**, and part of the common protocol this agent is audited against. Retained deliberately — **not implemented locally**. |
| **League / Submission** | **Common external protocol / delivery duty** (scoring, reporting, repos, Moodle) binding on the team as a whole. |

**No implementation status is claimed anywhere in this matrix** — every row remains
EXTRACTED / REVIEW REQUIRED / CONFLICT / NOT APPLICABLE. Nothing is IMPLEMENTED or
VERIFIED; implementation has not begun.

## Stage 1C — JSON contract references (specification-level, not implemented)

The JSON / crypto / reporting requirement families are now **CONTRACT-DEFINED** in
`docs/spec/json/` (no code). Statuses here remain specification-level
(CONTRACT-DEFINED / PROJECT-DECISION / REVIEW-REQUIRED) — **none is IMPLEMENTED or
runtime-VERIFIED**.

| Requirement family | Contract document(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| JSON-001..004 (four JSON docs, structure) | `json/{README,CONFIG,DECLARATION,LOG,RESULT}_CONTRACT.md`, `json/FIELD_MATRIX.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED |
| JSON-003 exact field names | `json/*_CONTRACT.md` + `json/PROJECT_CONTRACT_DECISIONS.md` | PROJECT-DECISION (some fields REVIEW-REQUIRED) |
| CRYPTO-001/002/003/008/009 (commit-reveal, canonical hash) | `json/LOG_CONTRACT.md`, `json/CANONICALIZATION_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED |
| CRYPTO-006 / PERF-002 (Step-0, token lock) | `json/DECLARATION_CONTRACT.md`, `json/SIGNATURE_AND_HASH_PROVENANCE.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED (Stage 1D.1 K1: **keyed authentication** `step0_auth`, HMAC-SHA256 default JDEC-013; primitive negotiable, requirement SOURCE) |
| REPLAY-002 (per-step verify) | `json/LOG_CONTRACT.md` §E | CONTRACT-DEFINED |
| REPORT-001/002, LEAGUE-002 (result report, mutual approval) | `json/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED; `result_sha256` = SHA-256-backed mutual acknowledgement (NDEC-006); missing/contradictory ⇒ 0 both (C-09); FastMCP + signed hardware mandatory (K3) |
| GIT-003 (`github_commit`) | `json/DECLARATION_CONTRACT.md`, `json/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED (SOURCE-EXPLICIT key) |
| GAME-006 scoring incl. technical_loss | `json/CONFIG_CONTRACT.md`, `json/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED (technical_loss provenance C-07 preserved) |

Cross-artifact invariants: `json/CROSS_ARTIFACT_INVARIANTS.md` (INV-01…INV-15).
Project decisions: `json/PROJECT_CONTRACT_DECISIONS.md` (**JDEC-001…JDEC-015**;
JDEC-015 added in Stage 3B-FIX1 — terminal threshold admissibility).

**Baseline after Stage 2A-R2** *(superseded — see the note below)***:** field matrix **75** rows — declaration 16,
config 39, log 9, **result 11**. *(Stage 1 originally locked at 77 rows with result 13;
Stage-2A-R2 **JDEC-014** superseded the project-defined duplication of declaration-owned
static metadata in the result, so the current matrix is 75.)* Requirements remain **91**.

> **Current FIELD_MATRIX baseline (Stage 4E-R12-R1):** **74 = 15 / 39 / 9 / 11.**
> Stage 4E-R12-R1 removed the declaration `token_usage_locked` row — Appendix E #54
> and Ch 9 §9.3.3 place **actual** consumed tokens in the **result**, while the
> declaration's source-defined role is "everything that does not change during the
> game". Declaration 16 → 15; grand total 75 → 74; provenance SS 13 → 12; status
> LP 9 → 8. **Every "75 = 16/39/9/11" below is a per-stage historical record and is
> correct as of the stage it describes** — those lines are deliberately left
> unrewritten. The **91**-requirement, **55**-Appendix-E and **32 = 14/9/9**
> Appendix-F inventories are **unchanged**: FIELD_MATRIX is a project-derived row
> model, and 74 is not a source count.

**Stage 1D (interoperability lock):** the contracts were independently audited and
locked for interoperable implementation. `json/STAGE_1D_AUDIT.md` (D1–D5),
`json/PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md`, `json/INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` (NDEC-001…007),
`json/INTEROPERABILITY_BLOCKERS.md` (**0 blocking**). Key resolutions: `verdict` =
`intent` (C-08); `state` PROJECT-LOCKED (JDEC-012); `config_sha256` non-self-referential;
`game_uid` SOURCE-EXPLICIT (kept).

**Stage 1D.1 (crypto & reporting corrections):** **K1** Step-0 and **K2** the config
signature exchange are **keyed authentication with a pre-supplied key** (SOURCE-
REQUIRED — Ch 5 p.55–56, App B p.128), **not** unkeyed SHA-256 digests and **not**
invented PKI; project default HMAC-SHA256 (JDEC-013, PROJECT-CONTRACT); envelopes
`step0_auth`/`config_auth` `{auth_alg,key_id,auth_tag}`, non-self-referential,
domain-separated (NDEC-005/007; INV-14/15). **K3** the emailed result is
**self-contained** — FastMCP endpoints + cryptographically-signed hardware
declarations (`hardware_auth`) are mandatory (INV-10/12/13). **K4** the
reporting-sanction conflict (Ch 9 per-side non-credit vs App E #35 game-void/0-both)
is recorded as **C-09** with the strictest 0-both rule (INV-11). `result_sha256`
mutual approval is SHA-256-backed acknowledgement (NDEC-006). **No key material** in
any artifact. Statuses remain specification-level; **nothing IMPLEMENTED**. Maps to
CRYPTO-006 (signed Step-0), CRYPTO-001/002 (commit-reveal), LEAGUE-002/REPORT-001/002
(reporting), PERF-002 (token lock).

**Completeness (updated Stage 1B):** every MUST / MUST NOT catalog requirement
appears above (exact modality of the full catalog: MUST 76, MUST NOT 9, SHOULD 4,
MAY 2 = 91). SHOULD/MAY rows are marked "Optional". **CONFLICT rows:** GAME-007
(C-01), STATE-004, STATE-005 (C-02). **REVIEW REQUIRED rows:** CRYPTO-009 (log
fields), JSON-003 (JSON field names). GAME-006 no longer CONFLICT (C-06 resolved;
C-07 technical_loss provenance noted). JSON-003 reclassified from CONFLICT (C-05
now closed) to REVIEW REQUIRED (field names → Stage 1C). All others **EXTRACTED**.
No row is IMPLEMENTED or VERIFIED.

**Phase-2 ownership (Stage 2-CLOSE):** all **91** requirements have exactly one primary
PRD owner — PRD-01 15 · PRD-02 11 · PRD-03 3 · PRD-04 10 · PRD-05 2 · PRD-06 14 ·
PRD-07 24 · EXTERNAL/SUBMISSION 12. Unmapped 0; duplicate primary 0. See
`prd/PRD_01_07_CROSSWALK.md`. **PRD-01…07 are APPROVED — PHASE 2 LOCKED; nothing is
IMPLEMENTED or VERIFIED.**

**Phase-3/4 progress (current):** PRD-01 and PRD-02 are **IN PROGRESS** — the
deterministic domain (Stages 3A/3B) and the local turn foundation (Stage 3C) are
implemented and tested, together with the local protocol phase machine
(Stage 4A, `STATE_MACHINE.md` graph enforcement only) and its transition evidence
(Stage 4B, R7 as scoped by `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md` event 10 — `source_phase` +
`target_phase` only, valid by construction, phase-path replay, **no** authenticity,
persistence or artifact claim) and the local series orchestrator (Stage 4C — the
current sub-game cursor and the one cursor-owned branch; `num_games` enforced as
exactly **6, FIXED** per App F T18 #1 and C-05, with score recording still
**pending**); PRD-03…07 remain **NOT STARTED**. `FIELD_MATRIX` is unchanged at
**75** — transition evidence and the orchestrator cursor are internal application
values and define no artifact field. The **20** architecture-level ports of `API_BOUNDARIES.md` remain
**design-level only**: none is implemented, `app.ports` does not exist yet, and any
future Python port signature is a **PROJECT-CONTRACT** decision rather than a
source-mandated API (Stage 4D-R1). Port count is an architecture count and does not
affect the 91 requirements or any register. The peer-visible protocol-timeline
family inventory is **10** (Stage-4E audit restored Event 8, "Move validation";
earlier planning said 9), and PRD02-FR-044's turn cursor is **`(sub_game, step)`**
for turn-scoped messages, with the phase check receiver-side under FR-062/STATE-003
(Stage 4E-R1). Both are architecture/PRD-consistency counts and change no
requirement, modality, Appendix-E/F value or register entry. Stage 4F-R1 adds `app.protocol_values` as the
shared home for protocol semantic primitives and records the internal digest
representation (lowercase 64-hex PROJECT-CONTRACT), the closed `Verified OK`/`TAMPERED`
audit verdict, and the `mutual_agreement` bool correction — all internal contract
consistency, changing no requirement, register or FIELD_MATRIX count. Stage-4F value-blocker readiness accounts at
category level as **2 ready / 6 deferred / 1 reconciled = 9**; the six deferred
categories expand to nine unresolved sub-items. Stage 4F implemented exactly the
two ready ones in `app.protocol_values` — `Sha256Digest` (lowercase 64-hex
PROJECT-CONTRACT, no hashing) and `FinalAuditVerdict` (`Verified OK`/`TAMPERED`) —
with `InvalidDigestError(ValueError)` as a supporting error, not a third value.
No requirement, register or FIELD_MATRIX count is affected.

**Stage 4E-R2 (peer message runtime contract readiness).** Documentation/design
only. The `app.peer_messages` module row now permits the pure stdlib
value-definition primitives (`typing`, `dataclasses`), immutable `domain` value
types and `app.protocol_values` at runtime use; `enum` is withheld because no
peer message defines a vocabulary of its own. All **10** peer-visible families
were re-audited against ten readiness criteria: **1 READY** (Commitment =
turn cursor + `Sha256Digest`, per PROTOCOL_TIMELINE event 5's "`H_commit` only"
plus the cursor independently required by **PRD02-FR-044** and **PRD06-FR-086**)
and **9 blocked**. `TurnCursor` is ready with `app.peer_messages` as its home and
remains a projection, not an owner. Requirements consulted and **unchanged**:
PRD02-FR-021/043/044/062/063, PRD01-FR-010/011/012/033/034/035/037,
PRD06-FR-060/061/063/064/065/066/067/080/081/082/083/084/086, BAR-001…005,
CRYPTO-002/008. Blockers recorded against existing contracts only —
`LOG_CONTRACT.md` §C `by_role` (Family 6), the absent barrier-placement reveal
path (Family 7), `INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` NDEC-006's residual
`mutual_agreement.confirmed` object form and the post-exchange timing of the bool
(Family 14), and unfrozen association shapes (Families 11, 12). `docs/spec/**`
was not edited. Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;
Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC
**7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; architecture ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase`
definitions **1**; peer-visible families **10**; PRD-02 requirement IDs **87**;
result fields **11**. No new source-level requirement.

**Stage 4E-R2-FIX1 (current result-agreement contract + construction errors).**
Documentation only. **NDEC-006** was corrected from the withdrawn
`mutual_agreement.sha256` / `mutual_agreement.confirmed` nested object form to
the live model — a separate top-level `result_sha256` and a separate
`mutual_agreement` bool set only after the two digests compare equal — with an
explicit scope limit recording that NDEC-006 freezes a **record** shape, not the
Event-14 **message** shape. **NDEC IDs remain NDEC-001…NDEC-007 (7)**; no
NDEC-008, JDEC-016, INV-16 or C-11 was created. `RESULT_CONTRACT.md`,
`FIELD_MATRIX.md`, `CROSS_ARTIFACT_INVARIANTS.md` (INV-11) and
`CONFLICT_REGISTER.md` (C-09) are unchanged; result artifact fields remain
**11**. A mechanical sweep found the same object form still asserted by three
**current** PRD requirements — **PRD06-FR-142**, **PRD07-FR-085** and
**PRD07-FR-190**, with FR-085 contradicting **PRD07-FR-080** in its own table —
which this stage was not authorized to edit; they are reported and tracked, and
the stage therefore closes PARTIAL. No requirement text, modality or ownership
changes: the affected IDs are recorded as **needing a future consistency
correction**, not as new or reclassified requirements. The future static
construction contract for `TurnCursor` and `Commitment` (built-in `ValueError`,
zero supporting error types, no coercion) introduces no requirement and no
register entry. Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;
Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC
**7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; architecture ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase`
definitions **1**; peer-visible families **10** (**1 READY / 9 BLOCKED**);
PRD-02 requirement IDs **87**; result fields **11**.

**Stage 4E-R2-FIX2 (PRD propagation + constant dependency).** Documentation
only. Three active requirements were corrected **in place** to the already-approved
separate-field result-agreement model: **PRD06-FR-142** (core exclusion list),
**PRD07-FR-085** (digest stored as a separate top-level field, resolving its
contradiction with **PRD07-FR-080**) and **PRD07-FR-190** (both reports carry the
same `result_sha256` and record `mutual_agreement = true` separately once the
comparison establishes equality). **PRD-06 and PRD-07 requirement-ID counts, IDs,
ordering, modality, ownership and provenance are unchanged**; nothing was added,
deleted, renumbered or reclassified, and no acceptance criterion was created to
carry the correction. PRD status is unchanged (**APPROVED — PHASE 2 LOCKED**).
Each corrected row is explicitly a **record** requirement and freezes no Event-14
message multiplicity, so **Family 14 remains BLOCKED-BY-PAYLOAD-SHAPE**. The
`app.peer_messages` module row was narrowly widened to permit read-only use of the
globally-FIXED `domain` constants `FIRST_SUB_GAME` and `FIXED_NUM_GAMES`; this adds
no layer edge (`app.orchestrator` already imports `FIRST_SUB_GAME` at runtime) and
creates no second numeric authority (`FIXED_NUM_GAMES: Final[int] = 6` is the only
`= 6` series length in the source tree). `RESULT_CONTRACT.md`, `FIELD_MATRIX.md`,
`PROJECT_CONTRACT_DECISIONS.md`, `CROSS_ARTIFACT_INVARIANTS.md` (INV-11),
`CONFLICT_REGISTER.md` (C-09) and the FIX1 change to
`INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` are all unchanged. Requirements remain **91**
(76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX
**75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; architecture
ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` definitions **1**; peer-visible families **10**
(**1 READY / 9 BLOCKED**); PRD-02 requirement IDs **87**; result fields **11**.

**Stage 4E — RESUME (TurnCursor + Commitment).** The one peer-visible family
Stage 4E-R2 proved ready is now implemented in `app.peer_messages`, together with
its supporting `TurnCursor` contract: exactly two classes, **0** supporting error
types, and 73 targeted tests per repository. `TurnCursor` implements the PRD-02 §8
turn identity `(sub_game, step)` traced to **PRD02-FR-044/FR-063**, with phase
admissibility left to **PRD02-FR-021/FR-062** (STATE-003) and no phase field;
its sub-game bound reads the App-F-FIXED `num_games` contract through
`domain.config_model`, and `step` carries no ceiling because `max_moves` is
per-sub-game locked configuration. `Commitment` implements the Event-5 payload
(`PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md`: "`H_commit` only") plus that independently-required
cursor, consistent with **PRD06-FR-061/FR-067/FR-081/FR-086** — it stores an
already-validated `Sha256Digest`, performs no hashing, and carries none of the
sealed-record fields of **PRD06-FR-060**. **No requirement was added, removed,
reclassified or re-owned**, and no register entry was created. Nine peer-visible
families remain BLOCKED and **Stage 4E as a whole is not complete**. Requirements
remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**;
FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**; INV **15**;
C-01…C-10; architecture ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` definitions **1**;
peer-visible families **10**; PRD-02 requirement IDs **87**; result fields **11**;
PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**.

**Stage 4E-R3 (Acknowledgement + Reveal reconciliation).** Documentation/contract
only. Re-derived from the authoritative book: Ch 5 §5.3.2 (p.51) for the
acknowledgement, Ch 5 §5.3.1 (p.51) for the sealed `Move`, Figure 6 (p.52) for the
exchange, and Ch 3 §3.4 (p.37) + Iron Rules (p.38) for the barrier action and its
truthful exact-location declaration. **Acknowledgement is READY-TO-IMPLEMENT** as
`cursor` + `h_commit`, consistent with **PRD06-FR-082/FR-083** and
**PRD02-FR-044/FR-063**; `LOG_CONTRACT.md` §C `by_role` is reclassified as **local
log attribution**, proved from **ARCH-001/002** (one opponent process) and
**PRD06-FR-048** (role immutable from `CONFIG_LOCKED`). **Reveal remains BLOCKED**,
reclassified to **BLOCKED-BY-VALUE-REPRESENTATION**: the source resolves that a
police barrier placement travels in the ordinary `move` action slot bound by the
same `H_commit` — consistent with **BAR-001/BAR-002**, **PRD01-FR-010/FR-035** and
**PRD06-FR-060/FR-084** — but no shared action semantic type has a reachable home
and the sealed `move` representation is unfrozen. Contracts corrected in place:
`LOG_CONTRACT.md` (§B/§C/§D rows + REVIEW-REQUIRED totals), `NDEC-001` (narrow
amendment, **NDEC count still 7**) and one `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md` conclusion line.
**No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016,
NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11 was created.** Peer-visible families remain **10** — no
eleventh barrier family. Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;
Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC
**7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` **1**; PRD-02 IDs
**87**; result fields **11**; PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**.

**Stage 4E — RESUME 2 (Acknowledgement foundation).** Implementation of the
contract D27 had already frozen; **no contract was re-derived and none changed**.
`Acknowledgement` implements **PRD06-FR-082** (binding receipt of a *specific*
`H_commit` for a *specific* `(sub_game, step)`) over the cursor required by
**PRD02-FR-044/FR-063**, reusing the `Sha256Digest` value from Stage 4F and the
`TurnCursor` from the previous slice — so **0** new supporting error classes and
**0** new dependencies. `LOG_CONTRACT.md` §C `by_role` stays **local log
attribution**, derived from the emitted/received direction plus the role frozen at
`CONFIG_LOCKED` (**ARCH-001/002**, **PRD06-FR-048**) and never transmitted;
`ack_of_step` stays the *persisted* name of `cursor.step`, not a second message
field; and no `accepted`/`ok` status exists, the reference FastMCP `{"accepted": …}`
snippet remaining **NON-BINDING**. `Commitment` and `TurnCursor` are byte-unchanged.
**Reveal remains BLOCKED-BY-VALUE-REPRESENTATION** — its two blockers are carried
forward to Stage 4E-R4. Peer-visible families remain **10**, now **2 implemented**
(Commitment, Acknowledgement) and **8 blocked**; **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT
COMPLETE**. One authorized regression-maintenance line in
`tests/app/test_peer_messages.py` replaced the now-implemented `Acknowledgement`
with the still-blocked `ResultAgreement` in a blocked-family absence assertion,
preserving the assertion count and all coverage. **No requirement was added,
removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11 was
created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F
**32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**; INV
**15**; C-01…C-10; ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` **1**; PRD-02 IDs **87**; result
fields **11**; PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**; timeline events **15**;
`num_games` **6 FIXED**.

**Stage 4E-R4 (shared physical action + canonical `move` representation).**
Documentation / architecture / contract only; **0 Python**; **CLOSED / COMMITTED /
CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R4-CLOSE. Re-derived from the authoritative book: Ch 5 §5.3.1/§5.3.2 (p.51), Ch 5 p.50, Ch 3 §3.4 + Iron Rules
(p.37–38). Freezes the action's **home** (a new domain-owned `domain.actions`,
reachable by `app.turn_service`, `app.peer_messages` and the future
`protocol.commitment`, none of which `domain` imports) and its **canonical
encoding** under the unchanged sealed key `move`: a tagged, structurally-exclusive
`{kind,value}` object, consistent with **PRD01-FR-002/FR-003/FR-010** (cells as
`[row,col]`, the FIXED `move_set`, one action per turn), **PRD01-FR-035** and
**PRD06-FR-060/FR-084** (barrier placement and its exact declared cell), and
**PRD06-FR-007** (canonically sorted arrays). Contracts corrected in place:
`INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` (**NDEC-001** amended — **NDEC count still 7**),
`CANONICALIZATION_CONTRACT.md` (Layer 2 note + three byte-affecting rows),
`LOG_CONTRACT.md` (§B/§D `[RR]` resolved, the Stage-4E-R3 note updated, one
illustrative reveal entry), `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md` (one conclusion line) and
`MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md` (a `domain.actions` row + an `app.turn_service` migration
note). The sealed set stays **exactly eight fields** — no `action`,
`barrier_target` or `action_kind` was added — and `domain.rules.Move` stays the
five-token movement vocabulary. **Reveal is reclassified
BLOCKED-BY-VALUE-REPRESENTATION → BLOCKED-BY-FUTURE-SEMANTIC-TYPE**; the other
nine families are unchanged, implemented families remain **2**, and **Stage 4E as
a whole is NOT COMPLETE**. **No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or
re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11 was created.** Peer-visible
families remain **10**. Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;
Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC
**7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` **1**; PRD-02 IDs
**87**; result fields **11**; PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**; timeline
events **15**; `num_games` **6 FIXED**.

**Stage 4E-R5 (shared physical-action foundation + `LocalTurnService` migration).**
Implementation of the design D29 froze; **CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at Stage
4E-R5-CLOSE. `domain.actions` now holds the only `ActionKind`, `MoveAction`,
`BarrierAction`, `PhysicalAction` and `InvalidPhysicalActionError`, satisfying
**PRD01-FR-003** (the FIXED `move_set` stays the movement vocabulary and gains no
barrier token), **PRD01-FR-010** (one action per turn, made structural by an
exclusive union), **PRD01-FR-002** (the barrier binds an exact `[row, col]`
`Position`) and **PRD01-FR-011/FR-012** (validate strictly before effect; state
byte-identical on rejection). Legality stays where **PRD-01 §17** and the LIVE
rules put it: bounds, role, the thief prohibition, adjacency, occupancy and quota
are never checked in a value constructor. Malformed *construction* raises
`InvalidPhysicalActionError(DomainError)` while message composition keeps the
built-in `ValueError`, an intentional split by layer ownership that creates no new
error class. `app/peer_messages.py` is **byte-unchanged**; `domain.rules.Move`
remains exactly five tokens. **Reveal is reclassified BLOCKED-BY-FUTURE-SEMANTIC-TYPE
→ READY-TO-IMPLEMENT** (**PRD06-FR-082/FR-083**, **PRD02-FR-044/FR-063** already
satisfied by `TurnCursor`); the other nine families are unchanged, giving **2
implemented, 1 ready, 7 blocked** of **10**, and **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT
COMPLETE**. **No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no
JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11 was created.** Requirements remain **91**
(76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 =
16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; ports **20**;
`ProtocolPhase` **1**; PRD-02 IDs **87**; result fields **11**; PRD-06 IDs **129**;
PRD-07 IDs **140**; timeline events **15**; `num_games` **6 FIXED**.

**Stage 4E — RESUME 3 (Reveal foundation).** Implementation of the shape R4 froze
over the value type R5 supplied; **CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at Stage
4E-RESUME3-CLOSE. `Reveal(cursor, action, hint)` satisfies the ordinary-reveal
content of **Ch 5 §5.3.2** (the action plus the verbal sentence, nonce withheld)
over the cursor required by **PRD02-FR-044/FR-063**, carrying the physical action
of **PRD01-FR-010** including a police placement's exact cell
(**PRD01-FR-002/FR-035**, **PRD06-FR-060/FR-084**). Structural validation only:
exact `(MoveAction, BarrierAction)` membership with subclass rejection and no
coercion, exact `TurnCursor`, exact `str`; malformed composition raises the
built-in `ValueError` while malformed *domain* construction stays
`InvalidPhysicalActionError(DomainError)` — an intentional split by layer that
adds no error class. `hint_max_words` (**PRD06**) stays LIVE, so empty,
whitespace and very long hints are structurally accepted. No canonicalization,
hashing or live protocol validation; `domain.actions`, `app.turn_service` and
`domain.rules.Move` are byte-unchanged, and `Commitment`, `Acknowledgement` and
`TurnCursor` are executable-AST identical to the parent after prose-only
compression. `app/peer_messages.py` is at **150/150 LOC** — compliant, but no
further family may be added there until Stage 4E-R6 reconciles module
organization. Peer-visible families remain **10**, now **3 implemented
(Commitment, Acknowledgement, Reveal) and 7 blocked**; no family was reclassified
by this slice, and **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE**. **No requirement was
added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11
was created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix
F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**; INV
**15**; C-01…C-10; ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` **1**; PRD-02 IDs **87**; result
fields **11**; PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**; timeline events **15**;
`num_games` **6 FIXED**.

**Stage 4E-R6 (remaining turn-protocol readiness + peer-message module
organization).** Documentation / architecture / contract only; **0 Python**;
**CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R6-CLOSE, including corrections
R6-FIX1 and R6-FIX2. Re-derived from the authoritative book: Ch 5 §5.3.2 + Figure 6 (p.51–52), Ch 5
§5.4 (p.55), Ch 2.2.1, Ch 6.5, Ch 7 §7.5 + Figure 10 (p.72–74), App E #14. Freezes
a four-module organization for the peer-message contracts — `app.turn_cursor`,
`app.peer_turn_messages`, `app.peer_final_messages` behind an `app.peer_messages`
façade re-exporting identity-equal classes — chosen by measured LOC and adding no
message hierarchy, enum or registry, consistent with `MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md` and the
inward dependency rule. **#11 Final nonce reveal is reclassified
BLOCKED-BY-VALUE-REPRESENTATION → READY-TO-IMPLEMENT**: it is one batched
per-side message over that side's own steps (**PRD06** commit-reveal integrity,
**PRD02-FR-044/FR-063** for the cursor), and the last gap — the nonce's structural
form — is frozen in **NDEC-001 in place** as the **PROJECT-CONTRACT** profile
`[0-9a-f]{32}` lowercase, `secrets.token_hex(16)` remaining REFERENCE-EXAMPLE.
*(Stage 4E-R6-FIX2: current v1 supports exactly one nonce representation, so
NEGOTIATED-PRE-MATCH means both peers echo that required profile before
`CONFIG_LOCKED`; a differing profile refuses counted play as a LIVE compatibility
check, never an `InvalidNonceError`, tampering verdict or invented sanction.)* *(Stage 4E-R6-FIX1 corrected the rationale: a fixed
case/length is **not** required for recomputation, since the receiver rebuilds the
record from the exact revealed string; it is kept for parser strictness,
NFC-invariance and a 128-bit entropy floor. CSPRNG production (**CRYPTO-010**) and
secrecy-until-reveal are producer/runtime duties, not structural checks.)* FIX1 also
froze the full inventory — `NonceValue` + `InvalidNonceError` in
`app.protocol_values`, `NonceRevealEntry` and `FinalNonceReveal` in
`app.peer_final_messages` — and the **sub-game batch boundary**, matching the locked
per-sub-game log artifact (**INV-02**, **JDEC-004**, **JDEC-007**). **#8 Move validation** (BLOCKED-BY-VALUE-REPRESENTATION →
**BLOCKED-BY-PAYLOAD-SHAPE**) and **#12 Final audit** (BLOCKED-BY-ASSOCIATION-SHAPE →
**BLOCKED-BY-PAYLOAD-SHAPE**) both keep their old labels only in the sense that they
remain blocked: the value-representation and association questions are answered, and
what is unfrozen for each is whether anything is **transmitted** at all — Figure 6
draws no arrow for either, and `LOG_CONTRACT.md` §E already fixes what the audit
records. `TAMPERED` (verdict) stays distinct from technical loss (sanction, p.55) and
from `FAILED` (protocol terminal). Contracts corrected in place:
`MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md` (three future module rows + an organization note),
`PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md` (events 8 and 12 marked REVIEW-REQUIRED with the Figure-6
evidence), `INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` (**NDEC-001** amended — **NDEC count
still 7**) and `LOG_CONTRACT.md` (the nonce PC default). Implemented families remain
**3**; peer-visible families remain **10**; **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE**.
**No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008,
INV-16 or C-11 was created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;
Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**;

fields **11**; PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**; timeline events **15**;
`num_games` **6 FIXED**.

**Stage 4E-R7 (peer-message module reorganization).** Pure behaviour-preserving
migration of the architecture D32 froze; **CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at
Stage 4E-R7-CLOSE. No requirement, contract or family semantics changed: the
values `TurnCursor` (**PRD02-FR-044/FR-063**), `Commitment` (**PRD06-FR-086**),
`Acknowledgement` (**PRD06-FR-082**) and `Reveal` (Ch 5 §5.3.2, **PRD01-FR-010**)
were relocated **unchanged**, proved by executable-AST equivalence against the
committed parent for all five moved definitions. `app.peer_messages` is now a
façade re-exporting identity-equal class objects, so every public import path is
preserved and the three committed behaviour test modules passed **with zero
edits**. `app/__init__.py`, `app/protocol_values.py`, `app/turn_service.py`,
`domain/actions.py` and `domain/rules.py` are byte-unchanged, and the import graph
stays acyclic and inward per `DEPENDENCY_RULES.md` and `MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md`. The
former 150/150-LOC capacity blocker is removed with real headroom in every module.
**No new semantic family was implemented** — `NonceValue`, `InvalidNonceError`,
`NonceRevealEntry`, `FinalNonceReveal`, `MoveValidation` and `FinalAudit` all
remain absent from Python, and `FinalNonceReveal` stays **READY-TO-IMPLEMENT** in
contract only. Peer-visible families remain **10** — **3 implemented, 1 ready, 6
blocked** — and **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE**. **No requirement was
added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11
was created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F

`num_games` **6 FIXED**.

**Stage 4E-R8 (final nonce reveal foundation).** Implementation of the contract
R6/FIX1/FIX2 froze; **CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R8-CLOSE.
Tests-first from the exact clean committed parents, with genuine RED proved while
all four production files were byte-identical to HEAD. `NonceValue` and
`InvalidNonceError(ValueError)` implement the NDEC-001 nonce profile
(**PROJECT-CONTRACT**, exactly `[0-9a-f]{32}`, never normalised);
`NonceRevealEntry` + `FinalNonceReveal` implement `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md` event 11
and Figure 6's *Final Reveal: all Nonces* (**PRD06-FR-087**, Ch 5 §5.4 p.55) as
**one batched message per peer per sub-game**, associated by `TurnCursor` alone.
Representation is separated from generation: **CRYPTO-010 stays a producer runtime
obligation** and secrecy-until-final-reveal stays a protocol invariant, so neither
is a structural check and a low-entropy-looking value is valid. Completeness,
uniqueness, ordering and same-sub-game agreement remain **LIVE**. No requirement
was re-owned and no contract text changed: `docs/` diff was **0** at implementation
time. `app/turn_cursor.py`, `app/peer_turn_messages.py`, `app/turn_service.py`,
`domain/actions.py` and `domain/rules.py` are byte-unchanged. **No nonce generator,
hashing, canonicalization, commitment verification or `FinalAudit`** — `FinalAudit`,
`MoveValidation` and the mutual result agreement stay `BLOCKED-BY-PAYLOAD-SHAPE`.
Peer-visible families remain **10** — **4 implemented, 0 ready, 6 blocked** — and
**Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE.** **No requirement was added, removed,
reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11 was created.**
Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F

`num_games` **6 FIXED**.

**Stage 4E-R9 (canonical commitment codec + recompute foundation).** Attempted and
**stopped `BLOCKED-BEFORE-CODE`** at the mandatory pre-code dependency audit, with the
stop accepted by supervising review. Five of the eight sealed members were exact and
implementation-ready — `move` (**PRD01-FR-003**, NDEC-001), `hint` (**PRD06-FR-003**),
`step`, `sub_game` and `nonce` (NDEC-001) — while `role`, `state` and `intent` had no
implementation-ready representation. **0 Python, 0 tests, 0 documentation** were
produced. No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned.

**Stage 4E-R9-R1 (sealed commitment semantic prerequisites reconciliation).**
Documentation / contract / architecture only; **CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at Stage
4E-R9-R1-CLOSE with **0 Python and 0 tests**. Resolves exactly the three R9 blockers and
two directly-related ambiguities, moving the sealed record from **5/8 to 8/8
contract-ready**. `intent` is frozen to the **SOURCE-REQUIRED** `truth`/`lie` vocabulary
(Ch 5 p.51 prints both words) under **PRD04-FR-016/017**; `role` to the
**PROJECT-CONTRACT** `police`/`thief` vocabulary under **NDEC-001**, with the repository
constants mapped explicitly and the PRD-01 score keys `{cop, thief}` (**PRD01-FR-070/071/072**)
recorded as a deliberately separate reporting vocabulary that is **not** edited; `state`
to the existing **JDEC-012 / NDEC-002 / PRD06-FR-068** own-known shape, tightened with
sorted duplicate-free barriers (**PRD06-FR-007**) and the `state.step`/`state.role`
equality invariants the builder must enforce before hashing. Complete future semantic
contracts for `ActorRole`, `Intent` and `SealedState` are frozen in a legal
dependency-safe home, `app.sealed_record_values`, with `DEPENDENCY_RULES.md` unchanged.
Also reconciled: the stale `LOG_CONTRACT.md` REVIEW-REQUIRED text for `state`, the
`[row,col]` coordinate citation (**JDEC-012**, not JDEC-006), **`ensure_ascii=False`**
propagated from **PRD06-FR-005** into the central canonical contract and **NDEC-003**,
and the three-layer separation keeping `E-HASH-MISMATCH` / `FinalAuditVerdict.TAMPERED`
above the pure comparison primitive. `ActorRole`, `Intent` and `SealedState` are **not
peer-message families** and are **not implemented**; peer-visible families remain **10**
— **4 implemented, 0 ready, 6 blocked** — and **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE.**
**No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008,
INV-16 or C-11 was created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;

**Stage 4E-R9-R2 (sealed record semantic values foundation).** Implementation of
the three semantic prerequisites Stage 4E-R9-R1 froze at contract level;
**CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R9-R2-CLOSE. Tests-first from the
exact clean committed parents, with genuine `ModuleNotFoundError` RED proved
while `app/__init__.py`, `app/protocol_values.py` and `domain/board.py` were all
byte-identical to HEAD. `ActorRole` implements the **PROJECT-CONTRACT**
`police`/`thief` vocabulary (NDEC-001) and `Intent` the **SOURCE-REQUIRED**
`truth`/`lie` vocabulary (Ch 5 p.51, **PRD04-FR-016/017**); `SealedState`
implements the own-known snapshot of **JDEC-012 / NDEC-002 / PRD06-FR-068** with
sorted duplicate-free barriers (**PRD06-FR-007**) that are never silently
repaired. The runtime `ROLE`/`VALID_ROLES` constants and the PRD-01 score keys
`{cop, thief}` (**PRD01-FR-070/071/072**) are unchanged and provably distinct
from the sealed vocabulary. Structural validation only: board bounds, barrier
legality, quotas, capture and the builder's `state.step == cursor.step` /
`state.role == role` invariants all remain with their owners, and **no opponent
truth is representable**. No serialization, canonical JSON, NFC runtime, UTF-8
codec, SHA-256, recomputation, digest comparison, `FinalAudit` or `protocol/`
package was added. `app/protocol_values.py`, `app/turn_cursor.py`,
`app/peer_turn_messages.py`, `app/peer_final_messages.py`, `app/peer_messages.py`,
`app/turn_service.py`, `domain/board.py`, `domain/actions.py` and
`domain/rules.py` are byte-unchanged, and **no committed test required
maintenance**. `ActorRole`, `Intent` and `SealedState` are internal semantic
prerequisites, **not peer-message families**: peer-visible families remain **10**
— **4 implemented, 0 ready, 6 blocked** — the eight sealed members remain
contract-ready, the original R9 codec scope is now implementation-unblocked but
not started, and **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE.** **No requirement was
added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11
was created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix

**Stage 4E-R9-RESUME (canonical commitment codec + recompute foundation).** The
scope the original Stage 4E-R9 correctly stopped on, resumed once 4E-R9-R1 and
4E-R9-R2 made all eight sealed members contract-ready and implemented;
**CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R9-RESUME-CLOSE. Implements
**CRYPTO-009** (every operation states exactly which bytes it covers) and
**PRD06-FR-001…FR-009** in the architecture-frozen `protocol.canonical` and
`protocol.commitment`: canonical JSON with `sort_keys=True`,
`separators=(",",":")`, **`ensure_ascii=False`** (**PRD06-FR-002/005**), UTF-8
with NFC-normalised text (**PRD06-FR-003**), LF and no trailing newline
(**PRD06-FR-004**); the eight-field sealed record of **NDEC-001** with the
`state` mapping of **JDEC-012 / NDEC-002 / PRD06-FR-068** and the action mapping
of **NDEC-001 / Stage 4E-R4**; and `H_commit` as unkeyed SHA-256 into the
existing `Sha256Digest`. Barriers are emitted in the order `SealedState` fixed
(**PRD06-FR-007**) — the mapper never sorts. The builder refuses
`state.step != cursor.step` and `state.role != role` **before hashing**, a local
composition defect rather than a `TAMPERED` verdict. One `compute_commitment`
primitive serves both the initial commitment and the later recomputation from the
revealed nonce (**PRD06-FR-065**: the nonce is consumed, never generated), and
digest inequality returns a plain `bool` — `E-HASH-MISMATCH` and
`FinalAuditVerdict.TAMPERED` remain owned above this layer, as Stage 4E-R9-R1
froze. Three supervisor known-answer vectors were verified **independently, before
production existed**, by a stdlib-only one-off script that imported no project
code, and match exactly in both repositories (**PRD06-FR-009**, cross-OS
byte-identity). `app/**` and `domain/**` are byte-unchanged and **no committed
test required maintenance**. `MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md`'s `protocol.commitment`
dependency list was reconciled to include `app.turn_cursor` — documentation
reconciliation of the already-frozen builder input, not a new decision. No
peer-visible family was added: peer-visible families remain **10** — **4
implemented, 0 ready, 6 blocked** — and **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE.**
**No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016,
NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11 was created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2);

**Stage 4E-R10 (final audit + move validation readiness).** Attempted and
**stopped `INVENTORY-CONTRADICTION` before any documentation change; 0 files
changed**, with the stop accepted by supervising review. Neither peer-visible
payload could be frozen. No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or
re-owned.

**Stage 4E-R10-R1 (final-audit inventory + audit-material exchange
reconciliation).** Documentation / architecture only; **CLOSED / COMMITTED /
CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R10-R1-CLOSE with **0 Python and 0 tests**. Separates
three previously-conflated things: the implemented `FinalNonceReveal` family; the
**SOURCE-REQUIRED** end-of-game audit-material / full-log disclosure (Ch 5 §5.4,
**PRD06-FR-100/101**) that lets each side reconstruct and verify the opponent's
commitments; and `FinalAuditVerdict`, which remains the **local** audit / log /
replay vocabulary owned by `infra.replay` and `LOG_CONTRACT.md` §E
(**PRD-07 REPLAY-001/002**). There is **no peer-visible `FinalAudit` verdict
family** — the source does not require one (Figure 6 draws no such arrow) and the
project declines to invent it; the source is **not** claimed to forbid it.
`ProtocolPhase.FINAL_AUDIT`, timeline event 12 and the **15**-event count all
survive, as does the TAMPERED sanction (**PRD06-FR-085/103/104**). The exact
interchange shape of the audit material is newly recorded as
**`AUDIT-EXCHANGE-PAYLOAD: BLOCKED-BY-INTEROPERABILITY-SHAPE`**, an
artifact/transport integration blocker and **not** a peer-message-family blocker.
A completed mutual audit is a **precondition to** `ResultAgreement`, which is not
the transport of a verdict and remains `BLOCKED-BY-PAYLOAD-SHAPE`.
`MoveValidation` remains `BLOCKED-BY-PAYLOAD-SHAPE`. **The derived peer-visible
family inventory is corrected 10 → 9** — **4 implemented, 0 ready, 5 blocked** —
and the official Conflict Register grows **10 → 11** with **C-11**, distinct from
the unrelated review-local label in `docs/prd/PRD_05_07_REVIEW.md`, which was not
edited. **No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no
JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-12 was created.** Requirements remain **91**

`num_games` **6 FIXED**. **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE.**

**Stage 4E-R10-R2 (MoveValidation existence + payload).** Attempted and
**stopped `BLOCKED-BY-EXISTENCE-EVIDENCE` at the existence gate; 0 files
changed**, with the stop accepted by supervising review. Opponent rejection of an
illegal move is SOURCE-ENTAILED (App E #14) but the mechanism is
SOURCE-UNSPECIFIED. No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned.

**Stage 4E-R10-R3 (move-rejection inventory + transport-response
reconciliation).** Documentation / architecture only; **CLOSED / COMMITTED /
CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R10-R3-CLOSE with **0 Python and 0 tests** — and
**PARTIAL**: the inventory correction is complete while the transport response
shape remains blocked. By supervising **PROJECT-CONTRACT** decision the
peer-facing rejection required by **App E #14** is placed at the transport/port
response boundary rather than modelled as a standalone `app.peer_messages`
family; the source is not claimed to forbid such a message. Game legality remains
owned by `domain.rules` / `LocalTurnService` through the existing
**`GameRulesPort`** (**PRD01-FR-003/004/005**, GAME-003), and the rejection
outcome by the existing **`E-PROTO-ILLEGAL-MOVE`**, so **no new port, semantic
concept or error ID** was created. Four acceptances are now explicitly distinct —
delivery/parsing, authentication (**PRD06** keyed-auth path), protocol
phase/cursor/order, and **game legality** — and the FastMCP `receive_move`
example's `accepted` is the second, not the fourth (**PRD02-FR-034/035**,
REFERENCE-COMPATIBILITY, not book-mandated). Timeline events 8 and 9 survive with
the count still **15**. The derived peer-visible family inventory is corrected
**9 → 8** — **4 implemented, 0 ready, 4 blocked** — and the official Conflict
Register grows **11 → 12** with **C-12**, distinct from the unrelated
review-local label in `docs/prd/PRD_05_07_REVIEW.md`, which was not edited. The
exact response shape remains **`MOVE-REJECTION-TRANSPORT-SHAPE:
BLOCKED-BY-TRANSPORT-SHAPE`**, since `API_BOUNDARIES.md` and **PRD02-FR-035**
defer concrete operation signatures to Stage 2B-2C and both peer ports are async;
`AUDIT-EXCHANGE-PAYLOAD` remains blocked in its own right. **No requirement was
added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-13
was created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix

COMPLETE.**

**Stage 4E-R11 (peer operation + transport contract reconciliation).**
Documentation / architecture only; **CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at Stage
4E-R11-CLOSE with **0 Python and 0 tests** — and **PARTIAL**: the operation
contract is complete, one integration blocker resolved and the other narrowed.
Freezes `API_BOUNDARIES.md` **O1-O7** over the already-committed port set
(**PRD02-FR-032**), the semantic operation inventory (**PRD02-FR-033**), the
reference tool names as compatibility aliases (**PRD02-FR-034**, not
book-mandated) and the deferral of concrete signatures (**PRD02-FR-035**).
**O1** resolves the async/message-shape conflation using the committed
`CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` rule that peer calls are *"per request… never
fire-and-forget for state-changing calls"*. **O2** separates a success result
from transport, parse, authentication and protocol failures, each retaining its
`ERROR_MODEL.md` identity. **O5** closes
**`MOVE-REJECTION-TRANSPORT-SHAPE` as RESOLVED-PROJECT / READY-TO-IMPLEMENT**: an
exact `bool` game-legality result on the turn operation, satisfying **App E #14**
and **PRD01-FR-003/004/005** while legality stays with `domain.rules` /
`LocalTurnService` through `GameRulesPort`, and `E-PROTO-ILLEGAL-MOVE` keeps
ownership of the rejection outcome. **O6** fixes the audit submission operation
(f) with per-sub-game cadence matching the `log_<game_id>_g<NN>.json` artifact
(**PRD06-FR-100/101**), transmits no verdict or digest (**PRD06-FR-104**), and
forbids a second audit schema. **`AUDIT-EXCHANGE-PAYLOAD`** is narrowed to
**`BLOCKED-BY-LOG-ARTIFACT-SHAPE`**: the finalized log document is classified
**LOCAL-ONLY** (D4/JDEC-007) and `LOG_CONTRACT.md` retains a REVIEW-REQUIRED item
on ack/reveal nesting, so promoting it to an interoperability payload is a
reviewed decision — `LOG_CONTRACT.md` was deliberately **not** edited. No
peer-message family, port or error ID was created; operation results and audit
material are **not** families. Peer-visible families remain **8** — **4
implemented, 0 ready, 4 blocked** — and **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE.**
**No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016,
NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-13 was created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2);

**Stage 4E-R11-R1 (log artifact interoperability + audit exchange
reconciliation).** Documentation / contract only; **CLOSED / COMMITTED /
CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R11-R1-CLOSE with **0 Python and 0 tests**. Resolves the
last integration blocker by reconciling the **SOURCE-REQUIRED** full-log
disclosure of Ch 5 §5.4 (**PRD06-FR-100/101**) with the historical LOCAL-ONLY log
classification. **JDEC-007 is amended in place**: logger mechanics, artifact
metadata and locally-derived verification annotations stay LOCAL, while the
finalized per-sub-game log's audit-disclosure core is SHARED/INTEROPERABLE at
final audit; key spelling and the separate-event `entries[]` nesting remain
PROJECT-CONTRACT. Audit completeness is proved against the frozen Stage 4E-R9
canonical mapping — the seven non-secret sealed members from the per-turn sealed
record, `nonce` from `audit.final_reveal[]` (CRYPTO-002 secrecy preserved), and
`H_commit` from `entries[].commit` — with **no tenth log field**, so
`FIELD_MATRIX.md` is unchanged at **75 = 16/39/9/11** with **9** log rows. The
remaining `LOG_CONTRACT.md` REVIEW-REQUIRED item (ack/reveal nesting) is
**closed**. `submit_audit` carries the exact JSON-native audit-disclosure core;
semantic equality is required and **whole-log byte identity is not**, with no
log-level hash added (**PRD06-FR-104**: evidence preserved, not transmitted).
Locally-derived verdicts — `entries[].verified`, `audit.result`,
`audit.tampered_step`, `FinalAuditVerdict` — are neither transmitted nor trusted
(**PRD-07 REPLAY-001/002** keep the verdict in the local replay path). A
CLOSE-time payload-core guard made the payload boundary deterministic: both
LOCAL-DERIVED-AUDIT and LOCAL-ARTIFACT-METADATA (`by_role`, `schema_version`) are
outside the `submit_audit` payload and create no optional wire semantics. **No
second audit schema** exists. Both integration blockers are now RESOLVED-PROJECT
and `INTEROPERABILITY_BLOCKERS.md` reads **Blocking items: None**; this changed
no family readiness. Peer-visible families remain **8** — **4 implemented, 0
ready, 4 blocked** — and **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT COMPLETE.** **No
requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008,
INV-16 or C-13 was created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E

**Stage 4E-R12 family (Step-0 + config negotiation + config lock readiness).**
Documentation / semantic-contract only; **0 Python, 0 tests, 0 schema, 0 runtime**;
**CLOSED / COMMITTED / CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R12-CLOSE over **20 paths per repo**.
Six stages, recorded as they actually happened rather than as the final answer:

- **Stage 4E-R12** froze the auth vocabulary (`AuthProfile` / `KeyId` / `AuthProof`),
  resolved the **bootstrap profile paradox** (`PRD02-FR-022` verifies the Step-0
  proof in `STEP0_NEGOTIATION`, two states before `PRD02-FR-080` froze
  `AuthProfile` at `CONFIG_LOCKED`, while `PRD06-FR-122` required that profile to be
  authenticated by evidence that did not yet exist), closed the live
  `HMAC-SHA256`/`HMAC_SHA256` spelling divergence in favour of the serialized
  identifiers, defined the previously undefined `step0_core`, and derived the
  `NegotiatedConfig` model. **It also wrongly marked Step-0 READY before the proof
  was complete, and edited four tracking documents it was not authorized to touch.**
- **Stage 4E-R12-FIX** restored those four paths byte-exactly from HEAD, produced the
  implementation-level readiness proof, amended `PRD06-FR-043`/NDEC-007 so the config
  `AuthProof` covers a **`ConfigLockContext`** rather than the App-B core alone (that
  core is byte-identical across every sub-game, so it bound no sub-game and none of
  the `PRD06-FR-048` lock-frozen values), and **withdrew the Step-0 READY claim**:
  `token_usage_locked` was simultaneously Optional and, per `PRD06-FR-029`, a
  mandatory member of the authenticated core, with cardinality **1** at top level in
  a two-team document.
- **Stage 4E-R12-R1** returned to the book and proved the field was a **misplaced
  runtime datum** (Outcome B). Ch 5 §5.5 joins the token duty to the Step-0 signing
  with `במקביל` — *in parallel*, not contained; Ch 9 §9.3.3 gives the declaration the
  role of fixing *"everything that does not change during the game"* and names only
  the **agreed ceiling**; **App E #54** (MUST) and **App F Table 18 #4** place actual
  consumption in the **final report**. The field was removed, its obligation already
  carried by `sub_games[].tokens` + `total_tokens`, and **`FIELD_MATRIX.md` was
  recomputed mechanically: declaration 16 → 15, grand total 75 → 74, SS 13 → 12,
  LP 9 → 8.**
- **Stage 4E-R12-R2** corrected an **overclaim in R12-R1's own reasoning**:
  `result_sha256` gives the **finally reported** totals integrity and mutual
  agreement, but proves nothing about whether every LLM call was metered or whether
  the totals match runtime/provider-observed usage. The source's separate
  requirement — actual consumption **monitored** and **cryptographically locked** —
  therefore remains a **mandatory runtime obligation with a SOURCE-UNSPECIFIED,
  not-yet-frozen construction**: **`TOKEN-ACCOUNTING-CRYPTO-EVIDENCE:
  BLOCKED-BY-CONSTRUCTION`**, owned by PRD-06. The stale `INTEROPERABILITY_BLOCKERS`
  row was repaired, and the repository-wide **74** baseline was swept and reconciled.
- **Stage 4E-R12-R3** closed a chronology contradiction R12-R1 had created: the cap
  was authenticated at event 1 while R12's own text said it was agreed at event 2.
  **MODEL A** was adopted — not for convenience, but because `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md`
  event 1 had always listed the **token cap** under *Known before*, `DATA_FLOW.md`
  had always placed it **inside** the Step-0 core, and event 2's *Known before* names
  only board/scent/scoring. The sweep also caught **NDEC-005 still excluding
  `token_budget_per_series` from the core** after R12-R1 had moved it in — two live
  contracts disagreeing about core membership, now reconciled.

**Final contracts.** Step-0 core = **19 members**; `Step0DeclarationExchange(declaration,
auth)`; `AuthProfile ∈ {HMAC_SHA256, ED25519}` provisioned out of band before `BOOT`,
with incoming `auth_alg`/`key_id` **compared, never used to select their own verifier**;
plain unkeyed SHA-256 inadmissible. `ConfigProposal(sub_game, config, profiles)` with a
**complete** 35-member core, never a delta. `ConfigLockEvidence(context, auth)` over
`ConfigLockContext{game_id, game_uid, sub_game, config_sha256, profiles}`; the four config
layers stay distinct and the local `CONFIG_LOCKED` transition never acquires a serialized
field. **`token_budget_per_series` is source-NEGOTIABLE with the project lifecycle
PRE-STEP0-AGREED / SERIES-WIDE / IMMUTABLE-AFTER-STEP0** — equality-only at event 2, never
counter-proposable; the locked config's copy MUST equal the authenticated declaration cap
(`E-CONFIG-MISMATCH` ⇒ refuse counted play). **Step-0 never authenticates a value agreed
only later.**

**Peer-visible families remain 8 — 4 implemented, 3 ready, 1 blocked** —
`ResultAgreement` (`BLOCKED-BY-PAYLOAD-SHAPE`) being the sole blocked family.
**No requirement, port, error ID, peer family, Appendix-E/F row or timeline event was
added, removed or reclassified; no C-13, JDEC-016, NDEC-008 or INV-16 was created.**
Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**;
JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**; INV **15**; **C-01…C-12**; ports **20**; error IDs **20**;
PRD-06 IDs **129**; timeline events **15**; `num_games` **6 FIXED**. **FIELD_MATRIX is
now 74 = 15/39/9/11** (SE 40 / SS 34; LS 20 / LP 12 / NPM 36 / LO 6; EX 0, BU 0) — a
**project-derived** row model, never a source inventory; every earlier "75 = 16/39/9/11"
in this document is a stage-stamped historical record and is correct as of its stage.
Two items are carried forward deliberately: the stale **result (13)** derivation prose
(authoritative row table has **11**), deferred to the ResultAgreement stage, and
**`TOKEN-ACCOUNTING-CRYPTO-EVIDENCE: BLOCKED-BY-CONSTRUCTION`**, which must receive its
own design + implementation stage before Stage 4 can close. **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT
COMPLETE.**
