**Reading the `Repository` (role-scope) column in this THIEF repository.** The value
is the **game role a requirement binds**, not an implementation assignment, and no row
is deleted on role grounds:

| Value | How this repository treats it |
|---|---|
| **Both** | Common obligation — **to be implemented by this repository** (and by the opponent). |
| **Thief** | This agent's own primary obligation — **to be implemented by this repository**. |
| **Police** | **Opponent-side obligation: validated/expected from the opponent**, and part of the common protocol this agent is audited against. Retained deliberately — **not implemented locally**. |
| **League / Submission** | **Common external protocol / delivery duty** (scoring, reporting, repos, Moodle) binding on the team as a whole. |

**No implementation status is claimed anywhere in this matrix** — every row remains
EXTRACTED / REVIEW REQUIRED / CONFLICT / NOT APPLICABLE. Nothing is IMPLEMENTED or
VERIFIED; implementation has not begun.

## Stage 1C — JSON contract references (specification-level, not implemented)

The JSON / crypto / reporting requirement families are now **CONTRACT-DEFINED** in
`docs/spec/json/` (no code). Statuses here remain specification-level
(CONTRACT-DEFINED / PROJECT-DECISION / REVIEW-REQUIRED) — **none is IMPLEMENTED or
runtime-VERIFIED**.

| Requirement family | Contract document(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| JSON-001..004 (four JSON docs, structure) | `json/{README,CONFIG,DECLARATION,LOG,RESULT}_CONTRACT.md`, `json/FIELD_MATRIX.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED |
| JSON-003 exact field names | `json/*_CONTRACT.md` + `json/PROJECT_CONTRACT_DECISIONS.md` | PROJECT-DECISION (some fields REVIEW-REQUIRED) |
| CRYPTO-001/002/003/008/009 (commit-reveal, canonical hash) | `json/LOG_CONTRACT.md`, `json/CANONICALIZATION_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED |
| CRYPTO-006 / PERF-002 (Step-0, token lock) | `json/DECLARATION_CONTRACT.md`, `json/SIGNATURE_AND_HASH_PROVENANCE.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED (Stage 1D.1 K1: **keyed authentication** `step0_auth`, HMAC-SHA256 default JDEC-013; primitive negotiable, requirement SOURCE) |
| REPLAY-002 (per-step verify) | `json/LOG_CONTRACT.md` §E | CONTRACT-DEFINED |
| REPORT-001/002, LEAGUE-002 (result report, mutual approval) | `json/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED; `result_sha256` = SHA-256-backed mutual acknowledgement (NDEC-006); missing/contradictory ⇒ 0 both (C-09); FastMCP + signed hardware mandatory (K3) |
| GIT-003 (`github_commit`) | `json/DECLARATION_CONTRACT.md`, `json/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED (SOURCE-EXPLICIT key) |
| GAME-006 scoring incl. technical_loss | `json/CONFIG_CONTRACT.md`, `json/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` | CONTRACT-DEFINED (technical_loss provenance C-07 preserved) |

Cross-artifact invariants: `json/CROSS_ARTIFACT_INVARIANTS.md` (INV-01…INV-15).
Project decisions: `json/PROJECT_CONTRACT_DECISIONS.md` (**JDEC-001…JDEC-015**;
JDEC-015 added in Stage 3B-FIX1 — terminal threshold admissibility).

**Current baseline (after Stage 2A-R2):** field matrix **75** rows — declaration 16,
config 39, log 9, **result 11**. *(Stage 1 originally locked at 77 rows with result 13;
Stage-2A-R2 **JDEC-014** superseded the project-defined duplication of declaration-owned
static metadata in the result, so the current matrix is 75.)* Requirements remain **91**.

**Stage 1D (interoperability lock):** the contracts were independently audited and
locked for interoperable implementation. `json/STAGE_1D_AUDIT.md` (D1–D5),
`json/PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md`, `json/INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` (NDEC-001…007),
`json/INTEROPERABILITY_BLOCKERS.md` (**0 blocking**). Key resolutions: `verdict` =
`intent` (C-08); `state` PROJECT-LOCKED (JDEC-012); `config_sha256` non-self-referential;
`game_uid` SOURCE-EXPLICIT (kept).

**Stage 1D.1 (crypto & reporting corrections):** **K1** Step-0 and **K2** the config
signature exchange are **keyed authentication with a pre-supplied key** (SOURCE-
REQUIRED — Ch 5 p.55–56, App B p.128), **not** unkeyed SHA-256 digests and **not**
invented PKI; project default HMAC-SHA256 (JDEC-013, PROJECT-CONTRACT); envelopes
`step0_auth`/`config_auth` `{auth_alg,key_id,auth_tag}`, non-self-referential,
domain-separated (NDEC-005/007; INV-14/15). **K3** the emailed result is
**self-contained** — FastMCP endpoints + cryptographically-signed hardware
declarations (`hardware_auth`) are mandatory (INV-10/12/13). **K4** the
reporting-sanction conflict (Ch 9 per-side non-credit vs App E #35 game-void/0-both)
is recorded as **C-09** with the strictest 0-both rule (INV-11). `result_sha256`
mutual approval is SHA-256-backed acknowledgement (NDEC-006). **No key material** in
any artifact. Statuses remain specification-level; **nothing IMPLEMENTED**. Maps to
CRYPTO-006 (signed Step-0), CRYPTO-001/002 (commit-reveal), LEAGUE-002/REPORT-001/002
(reporting), PERF-002 (token lock).

**Completeness (updated Stage 1B):** every MUST / MUST NOT catalog requirement
appears above (exact modality of the full catalog: MUST 76, MUST NOT 9, SHOULD 4,
MAY 2 = 91). SHOULD/MAY rows are marked "Optional". **CONFLICT rows:** GAME-007
(C-01), STATE-004, STATE-005 (C-02). **REVIEW REQUIRED rows:** CRYPTO-009 (log
fields), JSON-003 (JSON field names). GAME-006 no longer CONFLICT (C-06 resolved;
C-07 technical_loss provenance noted). JSON-003 reclassified from CONFLICT (C-05
now closed) to REVIEW REQUIRED (field names → Stage 1C). All others **EXTRACTED**.
No row is IMPLEMENTED or VERIFIED.

**Phase-2 ownership (Stage 2-CLOSE):** all **91** requirements have exactly one primary
PRD owner — PRD-01 15 · PRD-02 11 · PRD-03 3 · PRD-04 10 · PRD-05 2 · PRD-06 14 ·
PRD-07 24 · EXTERNAL/SUBMISSION 12. Unmapped 0; duplicate primary 0. See
`prd/PRD_01_07_CROSSWALK.md`. **PRD-01…07 are APPROVED — PHASE 2 LOCKED; nothing is
IMPLEMENTED or VERIFIED.**

**Phase-3/4 progress (current):** PRD-01 and PRD-02 are **IN PROGRESS** — the
deterministic domain (Stages 3A/3B) and the local turn foundation (Stage 3C) are
implemented and tested, together with the local protocol phase machine
(Stage 4A, `STATE_MACHINE.md` graph enforcement only) and its transition evidence
(Stage 4B, R7 as scoped by `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md` event 10 — `source_phase` +
`target_phase` only, valid by construction, phase-path replay, **no** authenticity,
persistence or artifact claim) and the local series orchestrator (Stage 4C — the
current sub-game cursor and the one cursor-owned branch; `num_games` enforced as
exactly **6, FIXED** per App F T18 #1 and C-05, with score recording still
**pending**); PRD-03…07 remain **NOT STARTED**. `FIELD_MATRIX` is unchanged at
**75** — transition evidence and the orchestrator cursor are internal application
values and define no artifact field. The **20** architecture-level ports of `API_BOUNDARIES.md` remain
**design-level only**: none is implemented, `app.ports` does not exist yet, and any
future Python port signature is a **PROJECT-CONTRACT** decision rather than a
source-mandated API (Stage 4D-R1). Port count is an architecture count and does not
affect the 91 requirements or any register. The peer-visible protocol-timeline
family inventory is **10** (Stage-4E audit restored Event 8, "Move validation";
earlier planning said 9), and PRD02-FR-044's turn cursor is **`(sub_game, step)`**
for turn-scoped messages, with the phase check receiver-side under FR-062/STATE-003
(Stage 4E-R1). Both are architecture/PRD-consistency counts and change no
requirement, modality, Appendix-E/F value or register entry. Stage 4F-R1 adds `app.protocol_values` as the
shared home for protocol semantic primitives and records the internal digest
representation (lowercase 64-hex PROJECT-CONTRACT), the closed `Verified OK`/`TAMPERED`
audit verdict, and the `mutual_agreement` bool correction — all internal contract
consistency, changing no requirement, register or FIELD_MATRIX count. Stage-4F value-blocker readiness accounts at
category level as **2 ready / 6 deferred / 1 reconciled = 9**; the six deferred
categories expand to nine unresolved sub-items. Stage 4F implemented exactly the
two ready ones in `app.protocol_values` — `Sha256Digest` (lowercase 64-hex
PROJECT-CONTRACT, no hashing) and `FinalAuditVerdict` (`Verified OK`/`TAMPERED`) —
with `InvalidDigestError(ValueError)` as a supporting error, not a third value.
No requirement, register or FIELD_MATRIX count is affected.

**Stage 4E-R2 (peer message runtime contract readiness).** Documentation/design
only. The `app.peer_messages` module row now permits the pure stdlib
value-definition primitives (`typing`, `dataclasses`), immutable `domain` value
types and `app.protocol_values` at runtime use; `enum` is withheld because no
peer message defines a vocabulary of its own. All **10** peer-visible families
were re-audited against ten readiness criteria: **1 READY** (Commitment =
turn cursor + `Sha256Digest`, per PROTOCOL_TIMELINE event 5's "`H_commit` only"
plus the cursor independently required by **PRD02-FR-044** and **PRD06-FR-086**)
and **9 blocked**. `TurnCursor` is ready with `app.peer_messages` as its home and
remains a projection, not an owner. Requirements consulted and **unchanged**:
PRD02-FR-021/043/044/062/063, PRD01-FR-010/011/012/033/034/035/037,
PRD06-FR-060/061/063/064/065/066/067/080/081/082/083/084/086, BAR-001…005,
CRYPTO-002/008. Blockers recorded against existing contracts only —
`LOG_CONTRACT.md` §C `by_role` (Family 6), the absent barrier-placement reveal
path (Family 7), `INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` NDEC-006's residual
`mutual_agreement.confirmed` object form and the post-exchange timing of the bool
(Family 14), and unfrozen association shapes (Families 11, 12). `docs/spec/**`
was not edited. Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;
Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC
**7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; architecture ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase`
definitions **1**; peer-visible families **10**; PRD-02 requirement IDs **87**;
result fields **11**. No new source-level requirement.

**Stage 4E-R2-FIX1 (current result-agreement contract + construction errors).**
Documentation only. **NDEC-006** was corrected from the withdrawn
`mutual_agreement.sha256` / `mutual_agreement.confirmed` nested object form to
the live model — a separate top-level `result_sha256` and a separate
`mutual_agreement` bool set only after the two digests compare equal — with an
explicit scope limit recording that NDEC-006 freezes a **record** shape, not the
Event-14 **message** shape. **NDEC IDs remain NDEC-001…NDEC-007 (7)**; no
NDEC-008, JDEC-016, INV-16 or C-11 was created. `RESULT_CONTRACT.md`,
`FIELD_MATRIX.md`, `CROSS_ARTIFACT_INVARIANTS.md` (INV-11) and
`CONFLICT_REGISTER.md` (C-09) are unchanged; result artifact fields remain
**11**. A mechanical sweep found the same object form still asserted by three
**current** PRD requirements — **PRD06-FR-142**, **PRD07-FR-085** and
**PRD07-FR-190**, with FR-085 contradicting **PRD07-FR-080** in its own table —
which this stage was not authorized to edit; they are reported and tracked, and
the stage therefore closes PARTIAL. No requirement text, modality or ownership
changes: the affected IDs are recorded as **needing a future consistency
correction**, not as new or reclassified requirements. The future static
construction contract for `TurnCursor` and `Commitment` (built-in `ValueError`,
zero supporting error types, no coercion) introduces no requirement and no
register entry. Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;
Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC
**7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; architecture ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase`
definitions **1**; peer-visible families **10** (**1 READY / 9 BLOCKED**);
PRD-02 requirement IDs **87**; result fields **11**.

**Stage 4E-R2-FIX2 (PRD propagation + constant dependency).** Documentation
only. Three active requirements were corrected **in place** to the already-approved
separate-field result-agreement model: **PRD06-FR-142** (core exclusion list),
**PRD07-FR-085** (digest stored as a separate top-level field, resolving its
contradiction with **PRD07-FR-080**) and **PRD07-FR-190** (both reports carry the
same `result_sha256` and record `mutual_agreement = true` separately once the
comparison establishes equality). **PRD-06 and PRD-07 requirement-ID counts, IDs,
ordering, modality, ownership and provenance are unchanged**; nothing was added,
deleted, renumbered or reclassified, and no acceptance criterion was created to
carry the correction. PRD status is unchanged (**APPROVED — PHASE 2 LOCKED**).
Each corrected row is explicitly a **record** requirement and freezes no Event-14
message multiplicity, so **Family 14 remains BLOCKED-BY-PAYLOAD-SHAPE**. The
`app.peer_messages` module row was narrowly widened to permit read-only use of the
globally-FIXED `domain` constants `FIRST_SUB_GAME` and `FIXED_NUM_GAMES`; this adds
no layer edge (`app.orchestrator` already imports `FIRST_SUB_GAME` at runtime) and
creates no second numeric authority (`FIXED_NUM_GAMES: Final[int] = 6` is the only
`= 6` series length in the source tree). `RESULT_CONTRACT.md`, `FIELD_MATRIX.md`,
`PROJECT_CONTRACT_DECISIONS.md`, `CROSS_ARTIFACT_INVARIANTS.md` (INV-11),
`CONFLICT_REGISTER.md` (C-09) and the FIX1 change to
`INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` are all unchanged. Requirements remain **91**
(76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX
**75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; architecture
ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` definitions **1**; peer-visible families **10**
(**1 READY / 9 BLOCKED**); PRD-02 requirement IDs **87**; result fields **11**.

**Stage 4E — RESUME (TurnCursor + Commitment).** The one peer-visible family
Stage 4E-R2 proved ready is now implemented in `app.peer_messages`, together with
its supporting `TurnCursor` contract: exactly two classes, **0** supporting error
types, and 73 targeted tests per repository. `TurnCursor` implements the PRD-02 §8
turn identity `(sub_game, step)` traced to **PRD02-FR-044/FR-063**, with phase
admissibility left to **PRD02-FR-021/FR-062** (STATE-003) and no phase field;
its sub-game bound reads the App-F-FIXED `num_games` contract through
`domain.config_model`, and `step` carries no ceiling because `max_moves` is
per-sub-game locked configuration. `Commitment` implements the Event-5 payload
(`PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md`: "`H_commit` only") plus that independently-required
cursor, consistent with **PRD06-FR-061/FR-067/FR-081/FR-086** — it stores an
already-validated `Sha256Digest`, performs no hashing, and carries none of the
sealed-record fields of **PRD06-FR-060**. **No requirement was added, removed,
reclassified or re-owned**, and no register entry was created. Nine peer-visible
families remain BLOCKED and **Stage 4E as a whole is not complete**. Requirements
remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**;
FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**; INV **15**;
C-01…C-10; architecture ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` definitions **1**;
peer-visible families **10**; PRD-02 requirement IDs **87**; result fields **11**;
PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**.

**Stage 4E-R3 (Acknowledgement + Reveal reconciliation).** Documentation/contract
only. Re-derived from the authoritative book: Ch 5 §5.3.2 (p.51) for the
acknowledgement, Ch 5 §5.3.1 (p.51) for the sealed `Move`, Figure 6 (p.52) for the
exchange, and Ch 3 §3.4 (p.37) + Iron Rules (p.38) for the barrier action and its
truthful exact-location declaration. **Acknowledgement is READY-TO-IMPLEMENT** as
`cursor` + `h_commit`, consistent with **PRD06-FR-082/FR-083** and
**PRD02-FR-044/FR-063**; `LOG_CONTRACT.md` §C `by_role` is reclassified as **local
log attribution**, proved from **ARCH-001/002** (one opponent process) and
**PRD06-FR-048** (role immutable from `CONFIG_LOCKED`). **Reveal remains BLOCKED**,
reclassified to **BLOCKED-BY-VALUE-REPRESENTATION**: the source resolves that a
police barrier placement travels in the ordinary `move` action slot bound by the
same `H_commit` — consistent with **BAR-001/BAR-002**, **PRD01-FR-010/FR-035** and
**PRD06-FR-060/FR-084** — but no shared action semantic type has a reachable home
and the sealed `move` representation is unfrozen. Contracts corrected in place:
`LOG_CONTRACT.md` (§B/§C/§D rows + REVIEW-REQUIRED totals), `NDEC-001` (narrow
amendment, **NDEC count still 7**) and one `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md` conclusion line.
**No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016,
NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11 was created.** Peer-visible families remain **10** — no
eleventh barrier family. Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;
Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC
**7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` **1**; PRD-02 IDs
**87**; result fields **11**; PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**.

**Stage 4E — RESUME 2 (Acknowledgement foundation).** Implementation of the
contract D27 had already frozen; **no contract was re-derived and none changed**.
`Acknowledgement` implements **PRD06-FR-082** (binding receipt of a *specific*
`H_commit` for a *specific* `(sub_game, step)`) over the cursor required by
**PRD02-FR-044/FR-063**, reusing the `Sha256Digest` value from Stage 4F and the
`TurnCursor` from the previous slice — so **0** new supporting error classes and
**0** new dependencies. `LOG_CONTRACT.md` §C `by_role` stays **local log
attribution**, derived from the emitted/received direction plus the role frozen at
`CONFIG_LOCKED` (**ARCH-001/002**, **PRD06-FR-048**) and never transmitted;
`ack_of_step` stays the *persisted* name of `cursor.step`, not a second message
field; and no `accepted`/`ok` status exists, the reference FastMCP `{"accepted": …}`
snippet remaining **NON-BINDING**. `Commitment` and `TurnCursor` are byte-unchanged.
**Reveal remains BLOCKED-BY-VALUE-REPRESENTATION** — its two blockers are carried
forward to Stage 4E-R4. Peer-visible families remain **10**, now **2 implemented**
(Commitment, Acknowledgement) and **8 blocked**; **Stage 4E as a whole is NOT
COMPLETE**. One authorized regression-maintenance line in
`tests/app/test_peer_messages.py` replaced the now-implemented `Acknowledgement`
with the still-blocked `ResultAgreement` in a blocked-family absence assertion,
preserving the assertion count and all coverage. **No requirement was added,
removed, reclassified or re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11 was
created.** Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**; Appendix F
**32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC **7**; INV
**15**; C-01…C-10; ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` **1**; PRD-02 IDs **87**; result
fields **11**; PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**; timeline events **15**;
`num_games` **6 FIXED**.

**Stage 4E-R4 (shared physical action + canonical `move` representation).**
Documentation / architecture / contract only; **0 Python**; **CLOSED / COMMITTED /
CI-GREEN** at Stage 4E-R4-CLOSE. Re-derived from the authoritative book: Ch 5 §5.3.1/§5.3.2 (p.51), Ch 5 p.50, Ch 3 §3.4 + Iron Rules
(p.37–38). Freezes the action's **home** (a new domain-owned `domain.actions`,
reachable by `app.turn_service`, `app.peer_messages` and the future
`protocol.commitment`, none of which `domain` imports) and its **canonical
encoding** under the unchanged sealed key `move`: a tagged, structurally-exclusive
`{kind,value}` object, consistent with **PRD01-FR-002/FR-003/FR-010** (cells as
`[row,col]`, the FIXED `move_set`, one action per turn), **PRD01-FR-035** and
**PRD06-FR-060/FR-084** (barrier placement and its exact declared cell), and
**PRD06-FR-007** (canonically sorted arrays). Contracts corrected in place:
`INTEROPERABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` (**NDEC-001** amended — **NDEC count still 7**),
`CANONICALIZATION_CONTRACT.md` (Layer 2 note + three byte-affecting rows),
`LOG_CONTRACT.md` (§B/§D `[RR]` resolved, the Stage-4E-R3 note updated, one
illustrative reveal entry), `PROTOCOL_TIMELINE.md` (one conclusion line) and
`MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md` (a `domain.actions` row + an `app.turn_service` migration
note). The sealed set stays **exactly eight fields** — no `action`,
`barrier_target` or `action_kind` was added — and `domain.rules.Move` stays the
five-token movement vocabulary. **Reveal is reclassified
BLOCKED-BY-VALUE-REPRESENTATION → BLOCKED-BY-FUTURE-SEMANTIC-TYPE**; the other
nine families are unchanged, implemented families remain **2**, and **Stage 4E as
a whole is NOT COMPLETE**. **No requirement was added, removed, reclassified or
re-owned; no JDEC-016, NDEC-008, INV-16 or C-11 was created.** Peer-visible
families remain **10**. Requirements remain **91** (76/9/4/2); Appendix E **55**;
Appendix F **32 = 14/9/9**; FIELD_MATRIX **75 = 16/39/9/11**; JDEC **15**; NDEC
**7**; INV **15**; C-01…C-10; ports **20**; `ProtocolPhase` **1**; PRD-02 IDs
**87**; result fields **11**; PRD-06 IDs **129**; PRD-07 IDs **140**; timeline
events **15**; `num_games` **6 FIXED**.
