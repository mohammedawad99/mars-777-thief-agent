"""The one software version this repository has, written two ways.

The excellence guideline §8.1 requires explicit version tracking whose **initial
value is 1.00**, held at `src/<pkg>/shared/version.py`. `1.00` is not a
PEP-440-stable string - the packaging rules normalise it to `1.0` - so declaring
that literal in `pyproject.toml` would publish distribution metadata that
disagrees with the declaration, which is two truths where the guideline asks for
one.

**So the value is stored once and rendered twice.** `guideline` is the literal
the guideline names; `pep440` is what packaging tools may safely round-trip. They
cannot drift, because neither is stored.

**This module owns the software version and nothing else.** The negotiated
configuration's own version, the interoperability pin and the wire profiles are
different concepts with different owners, and conflating them here would make a
local packaging fact look like a peer contract.

It imports nothing of ours on purpose: every layer may depend on it.
