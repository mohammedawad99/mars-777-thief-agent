"""Thief agent package for the 2026 Distributed Police-Thief P2P project.

Holds the identity constants that prove role and group separation, and the
software version authority's public rendering. The behaviour lives in the layers
below - `domain`, `app`, `protocol`, `transport`, `infra` - and the one surface
an external caller is meant to import is `mars777_thief.sdk`.

Nothing heavy is imported here on purpose: importing the package must not drag in
a transport framework or a game engine.
