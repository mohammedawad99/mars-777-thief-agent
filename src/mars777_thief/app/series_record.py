"""Deriving the series-level result facts from the six recorded sub-games.

Nothing here is supplied by a caller that could disagree with the record: the
score comes from `domain.scoring`, the cumulative totals from the six lines, the
played commit from the declaration, the four links from the two declared teams,
and the tokens from the ledger that metered them. A caller can decide *when* to
ask; it cannot decide what the answer is.

**Exactly six, ascending, once each.** `require_complete` is the one gate: a gap
means the series has not been played out, a repeat means one sub-game was
recorded twice, and a seventh cannot exist. Everything below it may therefore
assume a complete record instead of re-checking it.
