"""`mars777_thief.sdk` - the public programmatic surface of this agent.

**What it is.** One import path for every consumer of this repository: the
command lines shipped here, a future graphical interface, a future replay
viewer, and any third party who installed the distribution. Guideline §4.1 asks
for exactly one such boundary, and this is it.

**What it is not.** Not a layer with rules of its own. It holds no game logic, no
cryptography, no strategy, no transport and no provider mechanics; it forwards to
the composition modules that own them. Nothing here is a second opinion about
anything.

    from mars777_thief.sdk import AgentSdk, StrictSeriesRequest

    artifacts = asyncio.run(AgentSdk().run_strict_series(StrictSeriesRequest(launch)))

`KitBackendBoot` and `KitPublicLauncher` are exported because they are what the
two `compose_*` operations return, and a typed caller has to be able to name
them. They are project session objects, not framework types.

**The live view is a seam, not a screen.** `LiveViewSink`, `LatestSnapshot` and
`LiveViewSnapshot` are exported because a viewer has to be able to attach to a
running series and name what it receives. The drawing itself lives in
`mars777_thief.gui`, which *consumes* this facade: a presentation package
imported by the facade would point the dependency the wrong way, and would make
every command line load an imaging library to parse an argument.

**Stability.** The names in `__all__` are the promise; anything else in this
package is an implementation detail and may move without notice.
