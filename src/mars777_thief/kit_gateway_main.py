"""`python -m mars777_thief.kit_gateway_main` - the group's public front door.

One command brings up everything a partner needs to reach us: the stable group
gateway, its loopback-only admin surface, and one public route in front of them.
The role backends stay where they belong - independent processes in their own
repositories, on private local ports this passes through as configuration and
never advertises.

**Nothing here plays a game.** No board, no strategy, no scent, no digest, no
score: the gateway routes, the backends play, and this owns the operator's view
of the lifecycle. Which side plays which sub-game is the schedule's decision,
not this process's.

**Discovery every run.** The public endpoint is whatever this run's provider
discovery returned. No hostname is remembered between runs, none is committed,
and none is read from a previous session - a stale one is a route to somebody
else's tunnel.

Exit status is a classification: 2 for an operator input the launcher cannot
act on, 4 for a public route that never came up, 0 for a clean shutdown.

The assembly this file used to perform lives in `compose_gateway`, reached
through the facade like every other operation.
