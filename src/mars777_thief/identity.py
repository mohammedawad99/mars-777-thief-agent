"""Which side this repository is, as one constant nothing may override.

The role is a property of the **package**, not of a command line or an
environment variable: `infra.settings` checks the operator's value against this
and refuses a disagreement rather than obeying it. Keeping it here, below both
the facade and the composition modules, means every one of them agrees by
construction instead of by convention.
