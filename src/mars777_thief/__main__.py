"""`python -m mars777_thief` - start this agent and play its series.

The outermost file in the project. It reads the operator's settings and launch
document, composes the agent, and hands the process to `AutonomousBoot`, which
owns the lifecycle from there: serve, reach the opponent, exchange Step-0, run
the one production `SeriesDriver`, stop. Nothing here plays anything.

**It still does not dial by itself, and it still owns no game.** Joining the
opponent is a bounded startup step inside the coordinator, because two teams
start their agents independently and the first one up finds nothing to reach.
No Step-0, no action and no config leaves this module.

**Exit status is a classification, not a summary.** A local operator refusal
(settings, launch document) is 2, an opponent that never became reachable is 4,
and a peer that refused us for a protocol reason is 5 with its own frozen error
id printed - the identity, never the payload. A genuine local defect is
deliberately *not* translated: it keeps its traceback, because pretending a bug
is an unreachable peer is how a defect survives to the next stage.

Nothing printed here carries key material: the launch document holds no secret,
settings render theirs as `<withheld>`, and the summary names only a directory
and a count.
