"""A peer that runs the **production** result workflow, and reports its verdict.

Nothing about the result algorithm lives here. The process builds fixtures and
injects dependencies; `app.result_exchange.ResultExchange` owns the cadence, the
digest, the comparison and the completion verdict, so a defect in any of them
fails this harness instead of being masked by test-local arithmetic.
