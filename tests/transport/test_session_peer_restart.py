"""The rerun-8 interop failure, reproduced against a real server and survived.

Our outbound session is opened at startup, because opening it is what proves the
opponent is listening. In the rehearsal the opponent then restarted its own
runner before sub-game 1. The id we held named nothing, its server answered our
g01 greeting with HTTP 404, and the backend died on `E-TRANSPORT` having never
delivered a greeting - no sub-game played, the whole run lost.

Nothing here is simulated: a real FastMCP server is stopped and a new one is
started on the same port, which is what the peer's restart looked like from our
side. The assertion is that the greeting still arrives, on a session the peer
issued after its restart.
