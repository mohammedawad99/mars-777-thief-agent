"""The full two-request cadence, driven by the **production** workflow.

No test here compares a digest or computes one. Our peer owns a real
`ResultExchange`: it receives the proposer's request through the same production
entry point its server would use, then sends its own through
`PeerTransportPort`, and production verifies the digest that comes back.

The opponent is a genuinely separate OS process reachable only over FastMCP
Streamable HTTP, running the same production workflow on its side.
