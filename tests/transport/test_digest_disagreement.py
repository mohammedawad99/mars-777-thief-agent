"""A genuine digest disagreement is a typed failure, not a quiet `False`.

Before this stage the mismatch produced `is_agreed = False` and nothing else -
a peer whose approval core genuinely differed looked the same as a direction
that had simply not finished yet. `E-REPORT-DISAGREE` is the frozen identity for
that, and it now has a production branch.
