"""Disagreement across two processes, detected by production - not by the test.

The test supplies a structurally valid but divergent contribution and then does
nothing further: `ResultExchange` assembles, hashes, sends, receives and
compares, and raises `E-REPORT-DISAGREE` itself. Neither side records a verified
direction, and neither mutual state completes.
