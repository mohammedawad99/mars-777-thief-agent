"""What the built distribution promises to anyone who installs it.

The package ships a public SDK and is checked with `mypy --strict`, so a
consumer that installs the wheel should get the types too - PEP 561 makes that
conditional on a `py.typed` marker being **packaged**, not merely present in the
source tree. And the documented commands should be real commands, not a module
path a reader has to reconstruct.

These assert the built artifact rather than the working directory, because the
working directory is not what a grader installs.
