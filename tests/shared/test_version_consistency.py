"""Three places name this software's version; a guard keeps them one truth.

`pyproject.toml` cannot import a runtime constant without a dynamic-version
backend, and migrating the build backend to get one would be a large change for
a small guarantee. The declaration therefore stays a literal, and this test is
the mechanism that stops it drifting from the authority.
