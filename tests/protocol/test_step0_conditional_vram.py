"""The one conditional member of the Step-0 core, proved on both branches.

`hardware.vram_gb` is present **exactly when** `gpu` is not `False`. That makes
the produced core carry **18** present leaves for a CPU-only participant and
**19** for one with a GPU - while the *inventory* stays 19 members either way.
The two numbers answer different questions, and conflating them is what this
file exists to prevent.

The absent case must be an **omitted key**, never `null`: the canonical domain
refuses `None` outright, so emitting one would not merely be untidy - it would
make a lawful CPU-only declaration impossible to authenticate at all.
