"""Two real agents playing a whole six-sub-game series nobody scripted.

The lifecycle proof that came before this one chose the actions and the
outcomes; the sub-game proof that came after it played one game autonomously but
left the series bookkeeping to the test. This leaves nothing to the test: one
call to `play_series()` on each side produces six negotiated configs, six
naturally-terminating sub-games, six audited logs, a real result agreement and
the fourteen official files.
