"""One whole sub-game that nobody scripted, played by two real agents.

Every earlier lifecycle proof handed the turns their actions and the sub-game
its outcome. This one hands over neither: each side's own `BaselineStrategy`
picks its move from an `Observation` built out of its own truth, and the end
event comes back from `domain.terminal` after the real locked survival
threshold. The harness starts two servers and wires two drivers; it decides
nothing about the game.

The terminal is `SURVIVAL` by construction rather than by luck: the Stage-6B
police baseline has no belief, so it places no barrier and declares no capture,
which leaves exactly one source-defined way for this sub-game to end.
