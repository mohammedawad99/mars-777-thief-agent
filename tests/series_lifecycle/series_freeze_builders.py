"""Two real composed agents driving real config rounds, one model at a time.

Nothing here fakes a lock. The rounds are built from each side's own production
adapters, the proposal is the one `ConfigNegotiationRuntime` produces, and the
evidence each side accepts is the other's real keyed proof - so a refusal seen
by a test using these builders came from production code.
