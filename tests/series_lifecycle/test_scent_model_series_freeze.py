"""One agreed scent model, frozen for a whole six-sub-game series.

Two really composed agents, their production `PregameSessionRuntime`s and the
real keyed lock: `g01` establishes the identity by locking it, and every later
sub-game has to bring the same one back.

The test that matters most is the both-peers switch. Every per-sub-game layer
below approves it - the codec parses the new model, strict agreement finds the
two sides equal, and the lock proof verifies over its digest - and the series
still refuses it, because "we both changed our minds after g01" is exactly what
a series-wide agreement is supposed to make impossible.
