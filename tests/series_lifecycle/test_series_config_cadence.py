"""The order a config round has to happen in, and the defect that ignored it.

`PregameSessionRuntime.accept_lock` refuses evidence that arrives before this
side agreed a config - correctly, because a lock verifies *our* digest of *our*
config and there is nothing to compare against otherwise. The first
`SeriesDriver` adopted its config only just before sending its own lock, which
left a window in which our lock reached a peer that had opened its round but not
yet adopted. Both sides then raised `E-PROTO-STALE` at each other and `g01`
never got past negotiation.

The fix is sequencing, not tolerance: a round adopts the config it was opened
for at the moment it opens, so anything the peer sends afterwards has something
to verify against. These tests pin that, and they use the production
`SeriesDriver.open()` path rather than hand-built state.
