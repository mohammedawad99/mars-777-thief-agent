"""Booting two real agents and letting their own series drivers play all six.

The harness starts two servers, hands each side one valid series configuration
as boot input, and calls `play_series()`. It decides nothing after that: no
action, no outcome, no round bookkeeping, no config round, no audit call and no
result cadence - all of those are production owners now.

A configuration handed in as boot input is not a gameplay decision. What 6C-C1
proves is autonomous *execution* of the series and its negotiation protocol, not
an intelligent autonomous choice of negotiable values; the same locked values
are proposed for every sub-game except its own `sub_game` identity.
