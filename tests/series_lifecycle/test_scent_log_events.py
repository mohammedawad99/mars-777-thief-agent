"""The scent a turn really carried, written into the reveal event that carried it.

The log answers *what happened*, so the emission it records is the one that
crossed the live protocol: our own from the history the transcript retained when
we sent it, the peer's from the `TurnEvidence` we kept when it arrived. Neither
is re-projected from an action, a truth or a model - a log that recomputed its
own evidence would agree with itself no matter what was actually played.

The two histories are gathered by different owners, so they are bound to their
reveals by cursor and never by position in a list, and a counted sub-game whose
reveal has lost its emission refuses to finalize rather than writing a hole where
evidence belongs. Whether an emission was *physically* right is a different
question, and nothing here asks it.
