"""Booting two real agents and letting their own drivers play sub-game one.

Every earlier lifecycle proof handed the turns their actions and the sub-game
its outcome. This one hands over neither: each side's own `BaselineStrategy`
picks its move from an `Observation` built out of its own truth, and the end
event comes back from `domain.terminal` after the real locked survival
threshold. The harness starts two servers and wires two drivers; it decides
nothing about the game.

The terminal is `SURVIVAL` on purpose rather than by luck. The Stage-6B police
baseline has no belief, so it places no barrier and declares no capture - which
leaves exactly one source-defined way for this sub-game to end, and the tests
below let it run all the way there on source-compliant parameters.

**What is proved here is gameplay, not the series lifecycle.** `SubGameDriver`
owns the observation, the strategy call, the commit/acknowledge/reveal cadence,
the one-time truth adoption and the terminal derivation. Everything this module
adds around it is existing bookkeeping: `close_turn` carries a finished round's
peer evidence into the audit and takes neither an action nor an outcome, and the
loop continues only while **the drivers'** own `settled()` says the sub-game has
not ended. Composing that bookkeeping into `SeriesRuntime`, the exact-six
lifecycle and a CLI/two-process boot is Stage 6C-C.
