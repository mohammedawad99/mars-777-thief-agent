"""A counted sub-game may not write a log with a hole where its evidence belongs.

The two scent histories are gathered by different owners than the reveal events
they belong to - ours by the transcript when we sent, the peer's by the evidence
when it arrived - so they are bound back by cursor and never by position in a
list. A row that names another turn cannot stand in for a missing one, and two
rows naming the same turn are refused rather than resolved to whichever came
last.

*Counted* is established by the histories themselves: a session that negotiated
the scent-carrying turn contract emitted on every reveal, one that did not
emitted nowhere. Under it, the signal that a reveal completed is the same one the
capture row already uses, so a reveal that completed and lost its emission stops
the log rather than quietly writing an absence that would read as "carried none".
