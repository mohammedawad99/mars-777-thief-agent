"""What the two agreement cadences refuse to do on their own.

`agree_config` and `agree_result` order sends and waits and decide nothing, so
the only behaviour of their own they have is what they refuse. The non-proposer
branch of `agree_result` echoes the timestamp the proposer chose; it reads that
timestamp from `ResultExchange`, which owns it. If the milestone were ever set
without the state behind it, echoing `None` would send a request the peer could
not match - so the branch refuses instead, and this pins that refusal.

The state below is impossible through the protocol, which is the point: it is
reached by setting the milestone directly, exactly the mistake the "state
first, signal second" rule exists to prevent.
