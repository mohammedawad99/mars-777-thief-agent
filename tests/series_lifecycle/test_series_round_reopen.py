"""Opening a round that is already open must not throw the peer's work away.

Two independent processes have no way to agree who opens `g01` first. Whichever
finishes Step-0 first opens its round and proposes immediately, so the other
side can receive an authenticated proposal *before* its own `SeriesDriver.open()`
runs. That open used to call `open_round` unconditionally, and `open_round`
resets `opening`, `seen`, the config, the verified evidence and the milestones -
so the proposal, and the signal that it arrived, vanished. The peer sends
exactly one proposal per round, so the local side then waited forever.

Stage 6C-C1 never saw it: its in-process harness called `driver.open()` on both
sides before either could send anything, which is an ordering two OS processes
cannot provide.

The fix belongs to the caller that opened twice, not to `open_round`: opening
the round a side is *already* on is a no-op, and advancing to the next sub-game
still opens a genuinely fresh one. These tests pin both halves, plus the local
ownership invariant that keeps `open` from silently swapping our own candidate.
