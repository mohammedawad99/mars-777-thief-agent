"""A sub-game closes on the peer's audit material, not on ours being sent.

`semantic_review` replays the peer's own disclosed positions, so closing before
that disclosure arrived is refused - correctly - with `E-LOCAL-DEFECT`. Stage
6C-C1 never hit it: both drivers share one event loop there, and the awaited
sends interleave so the peer's disclosure always landed first. Two OS processes
schedule independently, and the side that finishes first found `disclosure`
still `None`.

The wait belongs to the driver and the fact belongs to the audit: `SeriesDriver`
sends its final nonce and disclosure exactly as before, then waits on the local
`AuditRuntime`'s completion signal, and only then closes. Nothing is resent and
no audit rule is relaxed - the barrier is local scheduling.

These tests drive the **real** inbound owner: the peer's material arrives
through `AuditRuntime.accept_final_nonce_reveal` / `accept_audit_disclosure`,
never by assigning `disclosure` behind the audit's back.
