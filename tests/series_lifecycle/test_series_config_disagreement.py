"""Two peers that boot with different legal configs must not both lock one.

`SeriesDriver.open()` adopts the config this side was booted with, which is what
lets an arriving lock be verified at all. The obvious worry is that adopting
early turns negotiation into a ceremony - each side rubber-stamping its own
input and locking regardless. It does not, and this is where that is proved.

The enforcement point is **not** the proposal. `ConfigNegotiationRuntime.accept`
validates a proposal's terms, profiles and scent model and then returns `True`;
it never compares the peer's config with ours, and `converges` has no caller.
Agreement is decided one step later, by `ConfigLockRuntime.accept`, which
recomputes *our* digest of *our* config and refuses evidence that names a
different one - `ConfigMismatchError`, the frozen `E-CONFIG-MISMATCH` identity.

The mismatch below uses `hint_max_words`, which App F T14 #2 marks NEGOTIABLE,
so both sides hold a fully legal config and no FIXED value is bent to
manufacture the disagreement.
