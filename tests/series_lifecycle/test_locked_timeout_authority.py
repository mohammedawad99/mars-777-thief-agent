"""Who owns the outbound deadline once the configuration is locked.

`response_timeout_sec` is NEGOTIABLE, both peers agree one, and it is written
into the official config artifact - and until this file existed the runtime
ignored it. The composition root built one `PeerClient` with a module constant
and nothing rebound it, so every gameplay request used that constant for the
whole series whatever the peers had agreed.

The reason it escaped is worth stating, because it shapes these tests.
`PeerClient.for_locked_config` and `TimeoutPolicy.for_config` were both correct
and both tested, and both had zero production call sites. Testing the pieces
proved the pieces; nothing crossed the seam where the pieces were supposed to
be joined. So these tests drive the **real** composed agent through the **real**
lock and then ask the client what deadline it would actually use.
