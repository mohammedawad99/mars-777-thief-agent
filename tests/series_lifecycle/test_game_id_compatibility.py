"""The official artifact identifier, and the group code it has to be able to name.

`NAMING_AND_IDENTITY.md` is explicit about provenance: the book **names**
`game_id` and `game_uid` (Ch 9 p.95) and does **not** fix their internal format,
so the format alone is PROJECT-CONTRACT - **JDEC-005**. The old format was
`[a-z0-9-]`, lowercase only.

That collides with two things the project does not get to change. `group_id` is
SOURCE-EXPLICIT (App E #45: exactly 8 characters, no spaces) and ours is
`MaRs-777`, uppercase included. And the kit derives `game_id` as
`"-vs-".join(sorted(pair))`, so our own group code appears inside it verbatim.
The result was an official namer that could not write a filename for a legitimate
game we had actually played.

So the **format** is amended - it is the project's to amend - and every safety
property the old rule bought is kept: no separator, no dot segment, no absolute
prefix, no whitespace, no control character can survive it.
