"""A completed counted series must report itself, with nobody typing a command.

Appendix E rule 32 requires the result of every legal game to be reported
**automatically**, and rule 35 makes each group's own report the condition for
being credited at all - non-reporting scores 0 for *both* groups. Until this
file existed the reporting service was complete and correct but only an operator
could trigger it, so a real series ended with a result on disk and no email.

The dispatch is deliberately downstream of everything that decides a game: it
runs after the mutual agreement and after the result is persisted, it is handed
the artifact that was written, and whatever the provider says can never change
what the game was.
