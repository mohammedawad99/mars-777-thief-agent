"""What the official log says about scent once it is read back off the disk.

A whole real series is played between two production agents over real FastMCP,
the fourteen official files are written by the real store, and every assertion
opens the bytes that landed and joins them against the semantic history the live
protocol left behind - never against the object that produced them.

The readback is semantic, not textual: the persisted deposits are handed to the
same Part-1A parser the audit disclosure already uses, and what comes out has to
be the `ScentEmission` the turn carried - same cells, same order, same `Decimal`
spellings, no float anywhere on the path."""
