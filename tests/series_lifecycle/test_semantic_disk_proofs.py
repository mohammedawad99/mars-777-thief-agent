"""The five capture routes, played by two real agents and read back off disk.

Each case runs one whole sub-game between two composed agents over the real
FastMCP transport, closes it through the production closure, and then opens the
official `log_<game_id>_g01.json` that was written. Nothing is asserted against
the runtime that produced the file - only against the bytes.

The thief plays no turn in these sub-games. That is deliberate: the questions
are all the police's, and a role that never moved still has a cell, which is
exactly what the replay reconstructs from the config it locked.
