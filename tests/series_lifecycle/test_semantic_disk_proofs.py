"""What a played sub-game leaves on disk, and how it replays from those bytes.

Each case plays a real turn and then reads the file back: an ordinary turn is a
question nobody asked, a true declaration replays as caught, a false one replays
as the claimant's own fault, and an illegal move is written as a technical loss
with the evidence that proves it.
