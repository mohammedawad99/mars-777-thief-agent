"""Six real sub-games, six config artifacts, one scent-model identity.

The series-freeze invariant is a runtime fact until the files are on disk; this
is where it becomes evidence. Every one of `g01`…`g06` is played by two real
agents over the real transport, and each config artifact is then read back and
verified through the production verifier - the model, its digest, and the
authenticated context that names both.
