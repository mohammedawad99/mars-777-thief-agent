"""The read deadline of a session that was opened before the lock existed.

Fix1 made `call_tool` carry the agreed `response_timeout_sec`, and Windows
still failed on `httpx.ReadTimeout` at thirty seconds. The reason was one
layer down and is a matter of *when*, not *what*: the peer session is opened
during startup, necessarily before Step-0 and the lock, and the HTTP client
built at that moment captured the pre-lock window as its read timeout and kept
it for the life of the session. The MCP call said forty-five; the socket read
underneath it still gave up at thirty.

Connecting before the lock is correct and cannot change - a client that
demanded a locked configuration could never make the calls that produce one.
What must change is that the captured number becomes a consulted authority, so
a request *built* after the lock carries what the peers agreed.

These tests therefore open the client first and lock second, which is the
order the runtime actually uses, and then ask a newly built request what read
budget it carries. `httpx` stamps `build_request` with the client's `timeout`
property at construction time, so that request is the honest witness.
