"""A real disclosed sub-game whose turns actually carried scent.

`evidence_builders` builds the pre-V2 shape - sealed turns with no emission at
all - which is exactly what keeps the legacy log fixtures honest. This adds the
counted-contract half, over the same two real halves `test_log_contract` uses:
our own police evidence owner, and the thief half whose disclosure a real
`AuditRuntime` audited. Both keep the emissions they retained live, so a log
rendered from them is the log a current sub-game would leave.

Nothing here invents an emission. Each one comes from `emission_of` under the
agreed model, and the two sides emit from **different** cells, so a test can tell
our own retained history apart from the peer's.
