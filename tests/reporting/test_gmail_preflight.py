"""The pre-match readiness check: safe to run, and never aimed at the lecturer.

Its job is to fail *early*. Appendix E rule 35 scores a missing report 0 for
both groups, so an expired refresh token must be discovered before a counted
series starts, not after a result exists.

Every test here runs offline. The one network call the command can make is an
OAuth refresh, and it is only reached when a real credential is configured.
