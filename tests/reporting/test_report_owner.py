"""Which of a group's two processes sends its one report, and why not both.

Rule 35 credits a group for its own report and scores a *contradictory* one 0 for
both groups. Under `FIXED_ROLE` exactly one MaRs-777 process existed, so nothing
had to decide; under the agreed alternating convention both role backends run,
both play three sub-games and both reach the dispatch point.
