Appendix E rule 34 is a prohibition with a zero-grade sanction: the completion
report goes **only** as an attached JSON file, never as free text. Rule 33 makes
the attachment a standard JSON structure, and Appendix F Table 20 names both the
file and the single address it goes to. These tests read the finished bytes, so
what is asserted is what a provider would receive.
