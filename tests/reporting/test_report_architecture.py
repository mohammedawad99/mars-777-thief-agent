"""That reporting reuses the gate that exists, and owns no second one.

Ch 9 §9.3.1 asks for **one** Gatekeeper pattern in the communication module.
A reporting path with a limiter, a queue or a backoff engine of its own would
satisfy the words and defeat the design, so the absence of a second one is
checked in the source rather than promised in a docstring.
