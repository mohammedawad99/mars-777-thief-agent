"""A restart must not mail the lecturer a second time.

Appendix E rule 35 penalises a *contradictory* report with 0 for both groups, so
sending the same series twice is not a harmless duplicate. `ReportService`
already refuses a second send inside one process; this is the part that survives
the process dying - the delivery record was always written, but nothing read it
back.

The key is the report identity - the agreed result digest - not the file name.
A different agreed result under the same `game_id` is a different report and
must never inherit an earlier receipt.
