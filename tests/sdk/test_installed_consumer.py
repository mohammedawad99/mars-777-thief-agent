"""An external consumer, importing only the installed package's public surface.

The proof §4.1 actually asks for is not that our own tests can reach the facade
- they can reach anything - but that somebody who installed the distribution and
read the README can perform a real operation without naming an internal module.
It runs as a separate process so an already-imported internal module cannot make
it pass by accident.
