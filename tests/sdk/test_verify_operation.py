"""The one facade operation that answers about a file rather than a network.

It is the operation an auditor actually wants: hand it a config artifact a real
series wrote and it says what the bytes prove, or refuses them. The verification
authority is the operator's provisioned key, read from the environment exactly as
it is at boot, because an artifact never carries the material needed to check its
own authorship.
