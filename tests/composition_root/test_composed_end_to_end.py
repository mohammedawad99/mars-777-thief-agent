"""The composed graph, driven for real: two agents, two sessions, one turn.

The production composition starts nothing, so this test does the starting - it
runs the servers it was handed, enters the clients it was handed, and binds the
runtimes. Everything it drives is the object graph `compose_agent` returned.
