"""Shared R16 fixtures: two participants and one finished series.

Duplicated per test directory on purpose - `tests/app` and `tests/protocol` have
no package, so each owns the helpers it imports.

`GROUP-XY` is byte-wise **lower** than `MaRs-777`, so the synthetic pairing seats
the opponent in `group_a` and **us in `group_b`** - the mirror of the real
pairing against `s82kma9e`. Fixtures therefore never name a slot: they name the
producing group and let `slot_of` seat it, which is what keeps a test from
quietly encoding one pairing's seating as if it were a rule.
