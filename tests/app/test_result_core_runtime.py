"""Assembling the shared core: the same inputs, the same bytes, either side.

The assembly must not depend on who performs it. Every test here builds the core
twice - once with the contributions in each order - and requires the two results
to be equal, which is exactly the property that was missing before the
participant-scoped members existed.
