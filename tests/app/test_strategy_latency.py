"""A move must be decided far inside the agreed response window, deterministically.

The peers agreed 30 seconds for a response, and that budget covers the whole
round trip - transport, the peer's own work, and ours. A strategy that merely
fits would leave nothing for the rest, so what is asserted here is a large
margin rather than a pass.

The bound is deliberately loose compared to what the strategy actually costs:
this runs on whatever machine a grader or CI happens to use, and a tight bound
would fail for reasons that say nothing about the code. Measured on the agreed
7x7 board the production policy decides in well under a millisecond; the guard
sits two orders of magnitude above that, so it catches a combinatorial
regression and nothing else.

**No move may depend on a network or a paid service.** A decision that reached
for an LLM would be non-deterministic, unbounded in latency, and unreplayable -
and the project forbids delegating legality anyway. That is asserted structurally
rather than by timing.
