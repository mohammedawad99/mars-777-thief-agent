"""Whose schedule decides a row's role, and the shortcut that got it wrong.

A counted series alternates, so the side a group takes is a **series-level**
fact. Deriving it from the executing process instead inverts all six rows in
whichever repository is not the group's first role - correct in one deployment
and silently wrong in the other. These tests pin the schedule from both sides so
that shortcut cannot come back.
