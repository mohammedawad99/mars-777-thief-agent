"""The acknowledgement peer message: a turn cursor and the acknowledged digest.

Ch 5 §5.3.2 (p.51) gives its whole content - *the opponent confirms it received
the commitment and is locked onto it* - which PRD06-FR-082 renders as binding
receipt of a **specific** `H_commit` for a **specific** `(sub_game, step)`. So
the message is that cursor plus that digest, and nothing else.

Three absences are deliberate (Stage 4E-R3). `by_role` is LOCAL-LOG-ATTRIBUTION
the writer derives from send/receive direction and the `CONFIG_LOCKED` role map,
so it is never transmitted and so never forgeable; `ack_of_step` is the persisted
name of `cursor.step` rather than a second field; and an acknowledgement is
positive by existing, so there is no `accepted` flag. `Commitment` carries the
same two component types and is still a different peer-message family - the class
identity is what says which.
