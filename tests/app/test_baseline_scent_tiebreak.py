"""Scent reaching a decision - as a tie-break, and only as a tie-break.

Ch 10 §10.3.3 put a *blind* baseline at the previous stage, *"blind in the sense
that there is not yet scent, natural language or deception"*. This is the stage
that ends the blindness, and the smallest honest way to do it is to let scent
decide only what the existing objective leaves undecided.

**The thief avoids the stronger evidence.** The police's emissions are legal
partial evidence of where it has been, so on an otherwise equal choice the
quarry prefers the quieter cell. It is a PROJECT-DERIVED tie-break, the mirror
of the pursuer's rule, and neither a source mandate nor a claim of optimality:
the room objective is untouched and still decides every case it can.

**Nothing else moves.** With no evidence, or with evidence equal on both
candidates, the ordering is exactly what it was before this stage - which is
what the regression corpus below exists to prove.
