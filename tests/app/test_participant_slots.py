"""Which participant sits in which slot, and every layout that is refused.

`group_a`/`group_b` order identifiers and nothing else. Both peers must derive
the same seating or they hash different bytes and neither Step-0 proof verifies,
so the layout is computed and checked rather than chosen and trusted.

The separation these tests defend: a slot is not a role, not a first mover and
not the running process. A group can sit in `group_b` and still take police in
sub-game 1.
