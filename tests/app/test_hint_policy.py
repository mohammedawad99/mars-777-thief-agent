"""The language policy: what this side says, and how honestly it means it.

Ch 6 §6.5.1 makes the template provider the book's own default - *"pre-written
sentences, selected in Python code - zero tokens, no network dependency"* - so
this path is the reference one, not a placeholder for a model.

Two properties carry the whole stage. **Nothing leaves without passing the
validator**, so a candidate that broke App E #27 could not reach `Reveal.hint`
even if a future author wrote one. And **`intent` is honest**: every sentence
here asserts only what `LocalTurnService.apply` has already established, so
`Intent.TRUTH` is a fact about the text rather than a default.
