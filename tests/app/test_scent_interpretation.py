"""Turning the emissions a peer actually sent into a belief a policy may read.

PRD-01 owns the physics and PRD-04 owns the reading of it, so this layer folds
and never computes: `observed_field` is the single accumulated-field authority
and there is no second decay, deposit, saturation or kernel anywhere below.

Three properties matter more than the arithmetic. The fold is **per full turn**,
because Ch 4 decays the environment once both actors have completed a turn and
one row per half-turn would age the field twice as fast. The parameters are the
**series-locked** ones, not the project defaults, so a model the peers agreed is
the model that governs what we believe. And the evidence is **only what already
arrived**: a decision cannot see the emission of the turn it is still deciding.
