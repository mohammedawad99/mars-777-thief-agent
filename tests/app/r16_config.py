"""The Appendix-F conforming negotiated config, kept apart from the fixtures.

Split out of `r16_builders` under guideline §3.2: the declaration builders and
this table are separate concerns that happened to share a file, and the file had
grown past the 150-code-line cap. `r16_builders` re-exports `config`, so every
existing `from r16_builders import config` keeps working.

Every number here is Appendix F's. Vary one with `dataclasses.replace` rather
than editing this table, so a test that needs a different value says which.
