"""The locked scent world these app tests interpret, built from the real model.

Duplicated per test directory on purpose, exactly as `r16_builders` is:
`tests/app` has no package, so it owns the helpers it imports rather than
reaching into another directory's module. Every value below is the production
default model's own - `default_scent_model()` is the authority, so a fixture
cannot drift from the physics it is meant to exercise.
