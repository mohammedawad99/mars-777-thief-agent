"""Where the strategy is forbidden to reach, asserted against its own code.

A strategy that could open a socket, read the final audit or re-derive board
geometry would be a second game engine wearing a policy's name. These guards
read the modules' *code* - literals and comments stripped by `r16_source` - so a
docstring explaining why a boundary exists never trips the guard that enforces
it.

The legality guard is the sharpest one: `baseline_strategy` may **call** the
rules, but the moment it contains a bound, a blocked-cell test or a coordinate
delta of its own, there are two legality authorities and one of them is wrong.
