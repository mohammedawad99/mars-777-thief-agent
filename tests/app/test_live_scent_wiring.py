"""The production path: does a real decision actually see the peer's emissions?

A neutral default is what keeps every existing `Observation` construction
working, and it is exactly what could hide a runtime that never wired anything
up - the suite would stay green while the agent stayed blind forever. So this
file exercises the live source rather than the value: it builds the belief the
way the running driver builds it, from the evidence the running runtime holds.

It also pins the two boundaries that make the belief lawful: a decision sees the
turns that already arrived and **not** the one it is still deciding, and a
sub-game starts from nothing rather than inheriting the last one's field.
