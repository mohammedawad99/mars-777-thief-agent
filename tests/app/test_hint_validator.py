"""The gate every outgoing hint passes, and the one prohibition it enforces.

App E #26 requires free natural language and #27 forbids a **direct
numeric-position protocol**. Those are two different rules, and the second one
is narrower than it first looks: it bans a coordinate channel, not arithmetic.
"I checked 3 corridors" is a sentence; `(3,4)` is a protocol. A validator that
could not tell them apart would enforce a rule the source never wrote and would
make ordinary speech unsayable.

`hint_max_words` is NEGOTIABLE with a floor of 1 (App F T14 #2), so the cap
under test is whatever a series locked - never the default 15.
