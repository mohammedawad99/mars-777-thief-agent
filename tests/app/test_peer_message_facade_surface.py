"""What the peer-message façade publishes, and what it must keep hidden.

Split out of `test_peer_message_module_layout.py` at Stage 4E-R15, which owns
*where values are defined* and the import direction between those modules. This
file owns the complementary question: which names the façade exposes. A family
belongs on it once implemented; the support values a family is built from never
do, and neither does any serialization or crypto surface.
