"""Where a six-row schedule comes from, and the operator flag it outranks.

Sub-game 1 decides all six rows, so whatever decides sub-game 1 decides the
series. It used to be a command-line flag defaulting to `police` - which meant a
forgotten argument inverted the whole series while every process still reported
itself healthy, and three processes each holding their own copy could disagree
about which backend owned the next message.
