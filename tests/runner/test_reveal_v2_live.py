"""Two real agents, one real reveal, and the opponent's scent actually arriving.

Nothing is hand-built here: the emission is projected by production from the same
action the turn seals, it crosses the real FastMCP route inside the reveal that
already existed, and the receiver keeps exactly what arrived. The response is the
`TurnOutcome` V1 always answered - scent changes no capture truth.

The profile half of the checkpoint is checked at the seam it belongs to: two
peers that do not both speak `..._SCENT_V2` are refused **before**
`CONFIG_LOCKED`, by the existing gate and the existing error identity.
