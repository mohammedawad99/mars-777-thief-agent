"""One real emission, sent once, and the only story about it the audit accepts.

Nothing is hand-built. Two production sides negotiate over real FastMCP, one of
them seals a turn and reveals it with the emission production projected from the
same action, the other retains exactly what arrived, and then the sender renders
its ordinary disclosure from retained history and sends that too. The emission
that crosses live and the emission in the document are asserted to be the same
object's value, not two equal-looking fixtures.

The second half is the same run with one member rewritten. The forged document is
*structurally perfect* - it parses, its entries still hash, its capture transcript
still matches - and it is refused anyway, because the scent it discloses is not
the scent that arrived. That is the property this checkpoint exists to establish:
history that has been observed cannot be re-authored at disclosure time.
