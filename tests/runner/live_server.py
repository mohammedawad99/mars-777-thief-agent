"""A real FastMCP server in this process, so a test can hold both sides.

Stage 5-R4 needs the *callback* topology: A sends a commitment, B's inbound
server accepts it, B's runner acknowledges, A's inbound server accepts that.
Both sides therefore have to be reachable over real HTTP while their runtimes
stay inspectable, which a subprocess cannot give. uvicorn runs in a thread; the
transport, the sessions and the servers are all production.
