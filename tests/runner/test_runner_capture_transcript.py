"""The five capture routes over the real wire, retained by both sides.

Every row below is produced by production code on both ends: the police declares
through `PeerRunner.open_turn`, the reveal crosses the real FastMCP transport,
the thief's own turn runtime answers from its own truth, and each side keeps the
row it really saw. No test writes a `CaptureRecord`, and the thief's position
never travels.
