"""Two production sides wired to each other in-process, with no network.

The driver's contract is about *ordering* - commit before acknowledging, adopt
after the peer's reveal, validate against the step's start board - and ordering
is exactly what a real socket makes hard to observe. So these two sides speak
through a loopback that hands each message straight to the peer's live turn
runtime: every owner is the production one, only the wire is removed.

`ActiveRuntimeContext` is on both ends deliberately. Production resolves the
current turn through it, so a harness that let the runner and the inbound path
read different runtimes would be testing a wiring nobody ships.
