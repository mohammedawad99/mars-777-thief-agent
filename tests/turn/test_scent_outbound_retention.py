"""What our own reveal deposited, kept by the side that sent it.

The receiver has held the peer's emission since Reveal V2 - `TurnEvidence.scent`
is the inbound authority and stays it. The sender held nothing: the emission went
out on the wire and was gone, so at the final audit there was no history to
disclose from and the only way to produce one would have been to project it again
from the action, which is exactly the rewrite the audit is supposed to detect.

So the transcript that already keeps our capture rows keeps this too, copied out
of the very `Reveal` being recorded. One tuple, outbound only: a second inbound
collection would be a second history of the same fact, free to drift from the one
that was witnessed.
