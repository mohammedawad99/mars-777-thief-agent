"""The V2 turn contract: one emission on the reveal, and nothing else moved.

`..._SCENT_V2` is a *new* posture rather than a redefinition of V1, so both
tokens still exist and each still means what it named. A session speaks exactly
one of them, and a reveal that contradicts the one it speaks is refused as a
malformed message - the postures were compared before `CONFIG_LOCKED`, so this is
a broken encoder, never a game event.

What the receiver keeps is the peer's own claim about what it deposited. It is
not recomputed, not checked against an opponent position nobody holds, and not
folded into any field: a full turn is two half-turns, and whoever decays the
world will know when one has completed.
