"""The whole live cadence, driven through production objects only.

No FastMCP, no transport, no test-double `PeerOperations` - the point of Stage
5-R1 is that this sequence now runs on production application code, which is
what Stage 4E-R18-R1-CR2 found missing.

**No primitive-regression test lives here.** `tests/protocol/test_commitment_digest`
already pins `compute_commitment` against known-answer vectors over the full
eight-field sealed record, which is stronger than anything this module would add
and is what Stage 5-R2 will rely on. Duplicating it would create a second place
to update when the primitive is touched. The runtime below never calls it.
