"""Reveal: the outcome the receiver can honestly report, everything else raises.

Stage 5-R8 replaced the legality bool. The receiver never learns the mover's
sealed pre-action cell, so it cannot decide whether their move was spatially
legal - that is proved at the final audit. What it reports live is public-fact
acceptance plus the capture answer, and the peer's action never moves our piece.
