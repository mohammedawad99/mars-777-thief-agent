"""A toolkit that records instead of drawing, so the window is testable anywhere.

CI has no display, and a window is exactly the part of a graphical program that
usually goes untested for that reason. These doubles stand in for `tkinter.Tk`
and `tkinter.Canvas` so every line of the window adapter runs on Linux, on
Windows and in a headless container - and so a test can read back what was
drawn instead of photographing a screen.
