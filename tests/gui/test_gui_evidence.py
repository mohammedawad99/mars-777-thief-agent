"""The two submission screenshots, produced by the real GUI from a real match.

`DOC-001` asks for a live belief-map picture and a replay picture showing the
verification result. Both come from one thirty-five-round sub-game that two
composed agents actually played here - the live one from the snapshot the thief
driver published on its last lawful turn, the replay one from the official log
that same sub-game wrote. Nothing is drawn by hand and nothing is staged.

The files are written into the repository only when asked for, so an ordinary
test run asserts the pictures without touching a single committed byte.
