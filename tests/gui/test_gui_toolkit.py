"""The real toolkit, on a machine that actually has a screen.

Everything else about the window is proved against recorders, because a CI
runner has no display. This file is the other half of that claim: wherever a
display exists, the same adapter drives the genuine `tkinter` widgets and draws
the same frame.

**Skipped by probe, not by platform.** Whether a window can open is a property of
the machine, not of the operating system name, so it is answered by trying once
rather than by guessing from `sys.platform`. A missing screen is not a defect.
