"""The real toolkit, on a machine that actually has one - and where it has none.

Everything else about the window is proved against recorders. This file is the
other half of that claim, in both directions:

* wherever a real toolkit and a real display exist, the same adapter drives the
  genuine widgets and draws the same frame;
* wherever the toolkit is simply **absent** - Debian and Ubuntu package it
  separately, and this project's own Linux CI has no `tkinter` - importing the
  graphical package still works, drawing to a file still works, and asking for a
  window produces a sentence with a remedy rather than a traceback.

Nothing here imports the toolkit at module scope, because that is exactly the
mistake it exists to prevent.
