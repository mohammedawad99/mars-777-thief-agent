"""Unit tests for the role-keyed scoring table.

App F Table 17 (FIXED): capture 20/5, survival 5/10, tie 2 each.
`technical_loss` 0/0 is binding through Ch 3 Table 2 + App E #48 and conflict
**C-07** — it is deliberately NOT an Appendix-F row. `diversity_reward` (10)
is league scope and must never enter sub-game scoring.
