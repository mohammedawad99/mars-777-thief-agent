"""What this side may believe about the opponent, and what it may never know.

Ch 6 §6.4 fixes the epistemic premise: *"neither of them sees the opponent's
real position"*. Scent is the legal partial evidence that premise permits - a
field of intensities this side observed, never a cell the opponent occupies. So
this value carries a **field** and nothing that names a position as truth: there
is no `opponent_position` to read, and no arithmetic here produces one.

**Neutral is a value, not `None`.** A sub-game opens with no evidence at all,
and a strategy that had to branch on `None` before every comparison would grow a
nullable path into every policy. The empty belief answers zero everywhere and
says so.
