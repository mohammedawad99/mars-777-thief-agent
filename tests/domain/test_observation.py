"""The privacy wall a strategy is allowed to see, and nothing beside it.

`Observation` is the only value a strategy receives, so what it *cannot* hold is
the load-bearing part of its contract: an opponent cell that never has a field
cannot leak through a code review that misses it. The field-set test below is
therefore written as an exact equality rather than a series of "does not have"
assertions - a new member fails it on arrival, which is the deliberate review
gate `PRD03-AC-001` asks for.
