"""That an emission came from the cell the move actually reached.

Scent is physical evidence, so the only honest emitter is the position the move
produced - after a step, after a stay, clipped by the real board at a corner, and
for the police, the cell it never left because it spent its move on a barrier.
The board and the cell both come from the one replay authority, never from a
second opinion written for checking.

    scent. The board handed to the recomputation must therefore be **per
    emitter** - start-of-step plus that emitter's own effect - and must not be
    the fully-applied end-of-step board the replay holds afterwards.

    Asserted against `Replay` directly rather than through an emission, because
    of a fact worth recording: `ScentField` consults only the board's *shape*
    (`ScentField.zero` takes `rows`/`cols`/`start_index`, and `_deposits` clips
    to bounds), never `board.blocked`. A barrier therefore cannot change any
    emission today, so the distinction is currently equivalence-preserving. It is
