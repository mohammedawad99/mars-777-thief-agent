"""Was the scent a reveal carried the scent its own disclosed action produces?

Parts 1A and 1B answered a different question. They prove the peer told the
audit and the log exactly what it told us live - which a peer that lied *live*
and then disclosed that same lie faithfully passes without difficulty. Nothing
before this recomputed the physics, so a deliberately misleading emission was
undetectable, and the book's own premise that a scent map "cannot lie" was false
in this architecture rather than true.

This closes it (`JDEC-018`). For every counted reveal the review recomputes the
emission from evidence the verifier anchors itself - the trajectory the semantic
replay already reconstructs from the config-locked start cells, the board that
emitter actually had, and the model the series cryptographically locked - and
compares it to the retained history. The centre is never taken from the scent
being judged, and the model is never the local default.

It is deliberately **not** tampering: every hash can verify and every disclosure
can be faithful while the emission is still physically impossible.
