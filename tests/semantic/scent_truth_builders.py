"""A real reviewed sub-game whose reveals actually carried scent.

`semantic_builders` seals turns without emissions, which is what keeps the
pre-V2 review honest. This adds the counted half: the same real producer, the
same real audit over real crypto, plus the emissions both sides retained live -
so a review driven from these owners is the review a current sub-game gets.

Every emission comes from `emission_of` under the **locked** model, on the board
the emitter itself had. Nothing here hand-writes a deposit map, so a test that
says "this is dishonest" is disagreeing with the domain's own physics rather
than with a literal someone typed.
