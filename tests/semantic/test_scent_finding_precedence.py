"""Which finding wins when more than one is true, and what is never written.

A broken trajectory or an illegal action outranks a scent mismatch, because the
reconstruction the scent check depends on has already failed. A legacy sub-game
with no scent at all is not dishonest, a mismatch is scored rather than called
tampering, and none of this persists a single fact about the opponent.
