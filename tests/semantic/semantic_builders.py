"""A real, legal sub-game - and the exact ways to make it a dishonest one.

Every value here is production-built: the sealed records come from a real
`OutboundEvidenceRuntime` over the real nonce source and the real SHA-256, the
peer's disclosure is rendered by the real writer, and the audit that receives it
is the real `AuditRuntime`. A test that wants a forgery therefore has to change
what the *game* says, not what the crypto says - which is the whole point of the
semantic layer.

The board is the locked one from the Appendix-F conforming config: a 7x7 grid
with the police at [0,0] and the thief at [3,3].
