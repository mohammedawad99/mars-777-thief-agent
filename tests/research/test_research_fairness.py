"""That no benchmark opponent knows anything production would not let it know.

An opponent that cheats produces evidence about a game nobody is playing. The
defence is structural: every policy is handed one `Observation`, whose four
members are the board, its own cell, its own quota and its own folded belief -
and which has no field an opponent cell, a nonce, an intent or a future draw
could arrive in.
