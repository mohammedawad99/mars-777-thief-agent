"""That the laboratory means the same thing the tournament does.

If the research harness and the counted agent disagreed about legality, capture
or the end of a game, every number this stage produces would describe a
different sport. So the harness is not compared to a description of production -
it is required to route through production's own authorities, and to reach the
same verdicts they do.
