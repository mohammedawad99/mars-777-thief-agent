"""The notebook explains; it must never be where a number is decided.

Two properties matter. It has to actually run against the committed evidence -
a notebook whose cells raise is worse than no notebook - and it must contain no
statistic of its own, because a cell is not covered by this suite and a number
that exists only there is a number nobody checks.

Executed with plain Python rather than Jupyter: the point is that every cell's
logic works and reads only committed files, which needs no notebook stack.
