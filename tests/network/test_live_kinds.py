"""Every peer kind that can be reached without a second group, over the public route.

A public tool-surface discovery is **not** a public kind proof: `list_tools`
returning four names says nothing about whether a `config_lock` payload ever
crossed the tunnel. Each kind below is sent through the real ngrok HTTPS URL and
confirmed against what the remote **application** recorded receiving.

All of it runs inside **one held `PeerClient` session**. That is the production
lifecycle this stage introduced, and it is also what makes the suite reliable:
one session per operation measured 20/30 over a real tunnel, one session for all
of them measured 30/30, in both experiment orders.
