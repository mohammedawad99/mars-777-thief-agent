"""Forty sequential peer operations over one public route, one held session.

This is the reliability gate the FIX2 measurement demanded. The same forty
operations opening a session each is precisely the pattern that failed from the
twenty-first onward over a real tunnel; through the production held lifecycle
they must all succeed, with no retry loop anywhere to manufacture the result.

`acknowledgement` is used throughout because it is inbound-only and carries no
game state: forty of them mutate nothing the rest of the suite depends on.
