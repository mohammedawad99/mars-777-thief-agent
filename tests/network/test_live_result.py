"""The public `ResultAgreement` direction, consumed by the real `ResultExchange`.

The weak version of this test would send an agreement and assert that 64 hex
characters came back. That proves the tunnel carries bytes and nothing else - it
is exactly the shape of defect the first R17 CLOSE caught, where a digest guard
existed but nothing in production reached it.

So the digest that returns over the public route is handed to the **production**
workflow. `ResultExchange._verify` calls `require_matching_digest`, which is the
only comparison anywhere in this file: the test asserts the workflow's own
recorded verdict and never compares two digests itself.

**One direction only, and stated plainly.** Our request crosses the public route
and the remote's production digest crosses back. The remote's *own* request
cannot reach us publicly, because that needs a second public hostname this
account cannot issue - so the peer's request #2 is constructed locally, exactly
as the R17 two-process cadence does. The mutual close over two public routes is
R18-R2's, and is not claimed here.
