"""Peer error identities survive the tunnel unchanged.

Every refusal below is produced by a **production runtime** on the far side -
`Step0Runtime.accept` and `ConfigNegotiationRuntime.accept` - and not by a
handler that raises on command. That distinction is the whole point: an injected
exception would prove the error mapping, not that a real application rejection
keeps its identity across a public proxy.

All five run inside **one held session**, which also proves a refusal does not
poison the session for the operations that follow it.
