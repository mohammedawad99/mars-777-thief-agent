"""One live public ingress, shared by every live module in this directory.

Session-scoped deliberately, and not only for speed. `PRD05-FR-015` gives a
group **one stable ingress for the series**, so raising and tearing down an
agent between assertions would contradict the model under test. It also removes
a failure we measured: back-to-back start/stop cycles on this account
intermittently had the provider terminate a freshly established session
mid-request, because the previous one had not yet been released.

The peer behind it runs the **production** runtimes, so a refusal in any test
below comes from the application rather than from a fixture.

Nothing here runs when the live switch is off - the fixture is only built for a
test that asks for it, and every such test is skipped.
