"""Whether a series may be called counted-clean, decided in exactly one place.

Two failure modes are being prevented at once, and they pull in opposite
directions. Treating an undecidable **binding** question as clean would let a
peer that disclosed too little be scored as if it had proved everything.
Treating an undecidable **project-enrichment** question as tampering would
accuse a lawful peer of cheating for using a leaner payload than ours.

So provenance decides what an undecided check means, and the answer lives here
rather than being re-derived at each call site.
