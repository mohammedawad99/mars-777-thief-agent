"""The KIT commitment: the nonce is beside the payload, not inside it.

`SHA256(kit_canonical(payload) + "|" + nonce)`, with a single U+007C. The kit
spells the separator out because all three plausible readings are
self-consistent under self-testing - sign and verify with the same wrong form
and every local test passes while every real handshake fails.

The two constructions are pinned against each other here so the difference is
proved rather than assumed: the same record under our project assembly and
under the kit's produce different digests, and both are correct for their own
profile.
