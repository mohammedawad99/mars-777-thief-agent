"""What a semantic check concluded, and what it is not allowed to imply.

Four outcomes, because three of them are routinely confused. A check that
**passed** and a check that **could not be decided** are different facts, and
collapsing them is how a lawful peer with a leaner payload gets recorded as a
cheat - or, worse, how an undecidable binding question gets recorded as clean.

The truthiness pin below is the one that earns its place. `Optional[bool]`
would have made `if status:` read as "passed", and `NOT_CHECKABLE` would have
silently answered yes to a question nobody could answer.
