"""Match identity both peers reach alone, and the agreement digest over the terms.

Two peers that name a match differently produce two sets of artifact filenames
and two reports nobody can join. The kit's fix is to derive both ids from
`sorted([group_a, group_b])`, so neither side has to be told the order and
there is no convention left for a pairing to settle - which is why the swapped
case below matters more than the canonical one.

`terms_signature` is a **content agreement digest**, not authentication: it is
unkeyed, and anyone holding the terms and the nonce can recompute it. Our
`HMAC_SHA256` Step-0 proof is what authenticates a peer, and no successful
comparison here may ever stand in for it.
