"""A peer's committed payload, kept as it arrived - and ours, built to be read.

Two values with opposite jobs. `PeerPayload` holds whatever JSON a lawful peer
sealed, unchanged, so its digest can be recomputed over the bytes it actually
produced; it makes no claim that the contents mean anything. `kit_payload`
builds *our* record, which is deliberately richer than the kit's minimum
because we already hold the evidence and disclosing it costs us nothing.

The asymmetry is the design. We are generous about what we reveal and strict
about what we assume: a peer that seals four keys is lawful, and our verifier
must not require the seven we happen to send.
