"""The external audit: two gates, and the honest gap between them.

A KIT peer's commitment chain can be perfectly verifiable while telling us
almost nothing about whether it played legally - the kit standardises
cryptographic correspondence, not payload meaning. So the audit asks two
separate questions and reports them separately.

**Gate 1** re-hashes the payload the peer revealed under the frozen codec. It
knows nothing about the game.

**Gate 2** weighs semantic evidence, and its vocabulary has four answers rather
than two. The pair that matters is `NOT_CHECKABLE` against `VERIFIED`: a peer
that sealed a leaner record has not proved it played legally, and recording
that as clean would score it as if it had. The other pair that matters is
`NOT_CHECKABLE` against `FAILED`: it also has not been caught doing anything,
and recording that as tampering would accuse an honest opponent.

Facts we already own are never asked of the peer. Role comes from the
authenticated session, the sub-game from the audit context, the configuration
from the verified lock, and the public barriers from the placements we
witnessed. A payload field may contradict those - which is a finding - but its
absence costs nothing.
