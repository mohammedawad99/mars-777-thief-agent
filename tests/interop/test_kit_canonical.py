"""The KIT canonical form, beside ours rather than instead of it.

Two canonical authorities exist on purpose. `protocol.canonical` serves the
**strict project domain**: it refuses `None` and binary `float`, carries
decimals as exact text, and is what every existing project hash is computed
over. `protocol.kit_canonical` serves the **KIT external profile**: the
JSON-native domain the pinned kit actually uses, floats included, so a peer's
bytes can be reproduced exactly as that peer produced them.

Neither may drift into the other. A permissive single function would silently
let a binary float reach a strict project hash, which is the one thing the
decimal-as-text design exists to prevent.
