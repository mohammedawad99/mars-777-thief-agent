"""Which authority stands behind each finding this project can report.

The classification is exhaustive on purpose. A finding that nobody classified
would reach the counted-clean policy with no rule attached, and the safe
default in that situation is not obvious - so the matrix is required to name
every verdict the semantic reviewer can produce, and a test fails the build if
a new one appears without a provenance.

The interesting rows are the enrichments. `DISHONEST_SCENT_EMISSION` is ours
under JDEC-018: it needs a disclosed trajectory to re-render an emission from,
and a lawful KIT peer never agreed to disclose one. Absence there must cost
nothing, while a *contradiction* remains a finding at any tier.
