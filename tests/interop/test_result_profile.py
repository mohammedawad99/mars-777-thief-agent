"""Which bytes a result agreement is hashed over, chosen once per profile.

Two encodings, and a semantically identical result hashes differently under
each - which is exactly the interoperability failure worth preventing. Our
strict profile hashes the compact project canonical form; the pinned kit hashes
its report with `json.dumps`' spaced defaults. A verifier that reached for the
wrong one would compute a mismatch over a result both sides agree on, and the
disagreement would read as being about the *game* rather than the serializer.

Sender and verifier reach the same authority, and the profile is frozen for the
series: there is no per-message choice and no fallback.
