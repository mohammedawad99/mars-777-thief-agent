"""The settlement consensus digest - the kit's deliberate *second* canonical form.

Everything else in the release hashes compact bytes; the report is hashed with
`json.dumps`' default **spaced** separators. That is not an inconsistency to
paper over: a verifier that reuses the compact form here computes a different
digest over a report both sides agree on, and the mismatch reads as a
disagreement about the result rather than about the serializer.

Sign-then-insert: the signature is computed **before** its own key exists in
the object, so verification pops the key, re-serializes spaced and re-hashes.
