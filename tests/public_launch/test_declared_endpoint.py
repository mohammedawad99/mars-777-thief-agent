"""The declaration must name the ingress this run actually opened.

The opponent found this in a rehearsal: our launch document carried a
placeholder `mcp_endpoint`, and the rehearsal transport still worked because the
peer URL was configured separately. Nothing failed, and nothing would have -
until a counted Step-0 authenticated bytes naming an address no opponent could
reach, which is the mismatch `FR-015b` exists to prevent.

The counted discovery path already refuses a loopback URL. What it could not see
is a declaration written by hand into a launch document, because those bytes
never pass through discovery. These tests pin the comparison that closes it.
