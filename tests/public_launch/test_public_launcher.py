"""Putting the group gateway behind one public route, and taking it down again.

Two things already existed and neither had a production caller: the group
gateway, and the ngrok-backed `PublicIngressPort`. This is the seam between
them, and it is deliberately thin - the ingress decides what a public endpoint
is, the gateway decides which backend a message belongs to, and this owns only
the order those two happen in and the guarantee that both are released.

**One endpoint is advertised, and it is the group's.** The role backends stay on
private local ports that never leave this process: not in the operator banner,
not in a pairing document, not in an artifact.
