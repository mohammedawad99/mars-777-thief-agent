"""The operator's word turning into what a run is allowed to be worth.

Nothing about a running process makes its own worth visible, so the distinction
travels from the command line rather than being inferred from a launch document,
a secret being present or an endpoint answering. These tests pin that the safe
value is the default, that the flag is the only way to leave it, and that the
run class an operator is shown follows the same decision.
