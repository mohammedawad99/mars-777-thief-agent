"""One production peer in its own process: real server, real adapter, real owners.

Nothing behind this server is a double. The nine inbound operations reach
`InboundPeerOperations`, which reaches `PregameSessionRuntime`, the turn and
audit runtimes and `ResultExchange` - so a refusal observed over HTTP came from
the application, and a binding observed over HTTP came from a real Step-0 keyed
verification.

The turn provider hands out one runtime **per operation**, each prepared for the
phase that operation legitimately arrives in. That is the lifecycle design R3
settled: providers are the caller's, and the adapter resolves one per call.
