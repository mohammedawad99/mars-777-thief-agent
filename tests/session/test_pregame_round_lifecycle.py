"""MODEL A: the series outlives the round, and the round leaves nothing behind.

Stage 5-R3R's pre-commit gate found that `opening`, `seen` and the adopted config
survived into the next sub-game, which would have refused the opponent's
legitimate `g02` opening proposal as a duplicate. `open_round` is the fix, and
these tests are the proof that nothing round-scoped crosses the boundary.
