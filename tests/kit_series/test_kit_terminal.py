"""The two settlement defects the first live sub-game exposed, pinned.

Observed 2026-08-18 against the pinned peer: MaRs-777 Police settled `CAPTURE`
and stopped talking while the peer waited out its budget and settled `timeout` -
the contradictory-reports shape App. E rule 35 zeroes on **both** teams.

Two distinct causes, and both are here:

**1. The self-capture rule is the thief's.** Rules 46/47 end the game at a
position only the *thief* can see - a barrier on its own cell, or no orthogonal
escape. `BAR-004` explicitly lets the **police** place a barrier on its own cell
and legally stand on a blocked one, so applying self-capture to the police
invents a capture out of a lawful placement.

**2. A terminal answer must ride out before we stop talking.** The opponent
cannot see the board; walking away holding the answer makes it wait out its
budget and settle a game it already lost as a timeout.
