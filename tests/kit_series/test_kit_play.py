"""Our own side of a KIT sub-game: the domain, driven by the kit's cadence.

Nothing here re-implements a game rule. Movement and placement go through
`LocalTurnService`, the scent field is the domain's own recurrence, the board is
the domain's board. What this layer owns is *when* each of them is asked - which
is the only thing the pinned wire actually changes.

The peer's smell grid is retained as the peer's. Folding a binary64 field into
our exact-decimal physics would assert an equivalence that is `MODEL_FORM_MATCH`
and **not** vector-exact, which is the claim the scent audit refuses to publish.
