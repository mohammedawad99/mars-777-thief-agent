"""The production play path itself creating and contributing official documents.

Standalone writer tests prove the documents can be built. They do not prove the
backend builds them, and a writer nothing calls is not a record - the same
lesson a rehearsal already taught this project about a guard nothing calls.

The other half is the deliberate silence: a development friendly given no
profile set contributes nothing rather than guessing one, so every existing
friendly keeps behaving exactly as it did.
