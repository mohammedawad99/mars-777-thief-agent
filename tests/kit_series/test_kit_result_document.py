"""The result artifact: the one file that must never be produced optimistically.

Rule 35 scores a series with no agreed result 0 for both groups, so every path
that would write one without a matching bidirectional digest is refused here.
The other property these pin is arithmetic that is easy to get quietly wrong:
`cumulative` counts role totals, which is a different axis from the per-group
standing the consensus aggregate carries.
