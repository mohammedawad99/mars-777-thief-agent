"""A valid agreement may arrive before this side is ready, and that is not a fault.

Both peers finish sub-game six at different moments and the proposer sends the
instant its own settlement completes, so a correct, authenticated request can
reach a receiver that is still publishing its sixth contribution entry. A live
four-process rehearsal produced exactly that, and refusing it would have lost an
agreement neither side got wrong.

The rule these pin: wait **boundedly** for our own half, then process the same
request; on timeout refuse explicitly and mutate nothing. Malformed and
unauthenticated requests are refused before any wait, because a sender that got
it wrong must not be made to hold a connection open.
