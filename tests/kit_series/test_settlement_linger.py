"""Staying reachable after the settlement, and the two bounds on staying.

rerun-9 settled correctly and this process still refused two `submit_audit`
calls that arrived one and three seconds after it had gone: the exchange returns
the instant the peer's envelope lands, `run()` returned, and the private surface
the gateway forwards to was released while the peer was still talking. Nothing
was lost that time because both sides had already agreed the same digest, but
rule 35 scores a series with no agreed result 0 for both groups, so reachability
at that moment is not something to leave to timing.

The two bounds are what make it safe to stay: never past the window both sides
agreed, and no longer than the peer keeps sending.
