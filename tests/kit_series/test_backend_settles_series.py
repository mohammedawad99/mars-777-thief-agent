"""`run` ends in a settlement rather than in an exit, for the side that owns g06.

The defect this closes was measured, not imagined: both role backends returned
the moment their own last sub-game was disclosed, the port the gateway forwards
`submit_audit` to was gone, and the peer's retries had nowhere to land.

Whichever repository this is, exactly one of its two role backends owns sub-game
6 - so the test asserts the settlement in that repository and asserts its
*absence* in the other, rather than being written twice with a role hard-coded.
