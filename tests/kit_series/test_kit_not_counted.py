"""What a perfect friendly is still not, and why nothing can turn it into one.

Six sub-games, every chain reproducing, both sides agreeing every row - and the
run is still **not counted**, for two independent reasons that this stage does
not weaken: the source requires keyed producer authentication at Step-0 and the
pinned peer offers only an unkeyed content agreement, and the sparring group is
synthetic rather than an enrolled opponent.

None of this depends on an operator remembering it. `counted_capable` is derived
from the run class, the readiness gate reads `step0_authenticated` from the same
fact, and there is no counted mail path in this build at all.
