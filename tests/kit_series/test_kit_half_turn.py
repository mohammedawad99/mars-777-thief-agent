"""Our own half of a turn: decided, sealed, and announced in that order.

The decision comes from the strategy, the seal from the commitment codec, and
the announcement from neither - which is what stops a move being chosen after
the opponent's is known. The thief's survival claim rides the turn that reaches
the threshold rather than arriving afterwards.
