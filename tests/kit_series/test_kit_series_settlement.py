"""The message a series is only over once we have received, and the port that left.

A real six-sub-game series ended without a mutual settlement: both role backends
returned the moment their own last sub-game was disclosed and exited, the gateway
forwards `submit_audit` to the backend owning the live sub-game, that port was
gone, and the peer's `series_consensus` retries had nowhere to land. Appendix E
rule 35 scores a series with no agreed result **0 for both groups**.

These tests pin every hop of that path: the claim decodes, it is told apart from
a sub-game chain, it survives a round trip, whichever backend owns sub-game 6
waits for it, and a closed window is reported rather than absorbed.
