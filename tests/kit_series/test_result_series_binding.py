"""Which identity a verified result agreement is answered as.

The proof half is `test_series_result_authority.py`. This is the binding half:
once a request has proved itself, the sender is resolved from the Step-0 that
established the series - and never from `contribution.group_id`, because letting
a request name its own author turns the downstream ownership check into `x != x`.
