"""The bounded handoff between two role backends, and what it refuses.

The pinned peer greets for the next sub-game the moment it has settled the
previous one, so a greeting for `n+1` can arrive while `n` is still draining its
audits. Acknowledging it into a queue nobody drains is the hazard the kit's own
docs warn about: the opponent burns its whole connect budget on a message we
said `ok` to and never acted on.

So the handoff has three explicit states, and a greeting is acknowledged only
once it has actually been assigned to the backend that will play it.
