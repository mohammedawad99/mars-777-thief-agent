"""One group URL, two private backends, and exactly one destination per message.

`teams.<group>.mcp_endpoint` is group-level. The opponent sees one MaRs-777 URL
for the whole series and never learns that two role backends sit behind it - the
private endpoints are an implementation detail and are never advertised.

Routing comes from the **contract**: the frozen convention, the sub-game number
and the agreed first assignment. Never from a source port, a process id, an
arrival time or a strategy output, and never by asking both backends.
