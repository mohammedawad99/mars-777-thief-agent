"""The one value that decides whether a run may ever be counted or reported.

A rehearsal and a counted run are one flag apart in intent and irreversible in
consequence: a rehearsal that reported would mail a lecturer a result nobody
agreed to count, and a counted run that did not report would lose a played
series. These tests pin the separation, and pin that it fails closed.
