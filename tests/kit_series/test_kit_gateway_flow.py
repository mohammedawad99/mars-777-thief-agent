"""The group gateway over a real client: what it publishes, routes and refuses.

One stable public surface in front of two private backends. These run against a
real client rather than a stub, because the thing under test is the forwarding
itself - including that a refusal crosses as its own error identity instead of
arriving as the gateway's.
