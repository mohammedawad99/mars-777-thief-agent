"""Every loopback call the backend cannot build itself is actually connected.

This is the defect a local rehearsal found and no unit test could: the fields
existed, the settler used them, and every test passed - because every test
injected its own callables. Production left two of the three at their refusal
defaults, and the police backend died the instant it finished sub-game 1.

So the assertions here are deliberately about **which object** each member is,
not about behaviour: a test that merely watched one of them work is exactly the
test that already passed while production was broken. Bound methods are rebuilt
on every attribute access, so equality - not `is` - is what compares them.
