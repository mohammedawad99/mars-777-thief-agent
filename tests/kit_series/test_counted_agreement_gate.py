"""The real defect, pinned: an alternating counted series must report itself.

A counted series against `s82kma9e` completed six sub-games, six mutual audits
and a genuine bidirectional settlement, wrote fourteen artifacts, and mailed
nobody. These are the blocking tests for the repair, and nothing more: each one
fails on the shipped defect and passes on the fix.

The order the finalisation must follow is the subject. A result becomes
reportable only after **both** participants' own contributions exist and both
independently computed digests match; before that every path must refuse, and
the refusal must not damage the series that was actually played.
