"""Reading the settlement terms out of the frozen contract, and refusing bad ones.

The window, the retry cadence and the scent registration are all *agreed*
numbers: one side shortening a window or inventing a digest is a side that fails
to settle with a peer that did neither. So every one of them is read from the
agreement, and a member the agreement cannot supply is refused rather than
defaulted.
