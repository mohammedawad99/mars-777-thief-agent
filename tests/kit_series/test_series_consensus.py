"""The digest two teams settle a series on, anchored to one a real peer accepted.

This is the last exchange of a counted series and the one rule 35 scores: a
series with no agreed result is **0 for both groups**. It is also the exchange
where two conformant implementations most easily produce different bytes for the
same facts, because "canonical JSON" names two different forms and the wrong one
can never match.

The anchor is not synthetic. `EXPECTED` is the digest a real opponent accepted in
a live settlement, and `ROWS` are that series' own six rows.
