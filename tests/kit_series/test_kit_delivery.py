"""The at-least-once receiver contract, against the pinned decision table.

Every row below is the kit's, and every decision is ours. The distinction the
table exists to protect: a redelivery is **absorbed** and changes nothing, while
the same step under a *different* commit is an **equivocation** and stays loud -
a `(kind, step)` dedupe key would collapse the second silently into the first.
