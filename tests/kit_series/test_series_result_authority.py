"""Proving a `result_agreement` that arrives on a session proving nothing.

`RESULT_CONTRACT.md` R13-R1-8 requires *the authenticated sender identity*.
Holding it in one Streamable-HTTP session is this project's own choice, and a
peer whose client opens a session per call satisfies the property while failing
the choice. So such a request carries its own keyed proof.

This suite is the proof half: what verifies, and every way one does not. The
binding half - which identity a verified request is then answered as - is
`test_result_series_binding.py`.
