"""Shared fixtures for the two result-agreement authentication suites.

The synthetic key is published: these vectors are the ones the pairing exchanged,
and a vector nobody else can recompute proves nothing. `KEY` is the secret's own
UTF-8 bytes because that is what production does - it never hex-decodes, and two
vectors published on the opposite assumption were wrong.
