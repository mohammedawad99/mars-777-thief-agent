"""Where a token count in a counted result may come from, and where it may not.

`result_core_runtime` is explicit that contributed counts are what a participant
**reported**, and that nothing downstream treats them as verified provider usage.
Stage 9C briefly mapped an absent peer contribution to a reported `0`; that was
wrong and is gone. A count exists only because its owner contributed it.

Our own count comes from the local accounting authority — `TokenAccountingPort`,
production implementation `SeriesTokenLedger`. If it answers zero, zero is
legitimate **because the authority answered**, not because a field was absent.
