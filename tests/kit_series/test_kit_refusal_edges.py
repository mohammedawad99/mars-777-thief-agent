"""What the backend and the gateway refuse, and how the refusal crosses.

A refusal has to arrive as its **own** error identity: a peer that is told
somebody else's failure cannot act on it, and a defect that arrives wearing a
protocol error survives to the next stage. These pin the translation at both
surfaces the operator actually exposes.
