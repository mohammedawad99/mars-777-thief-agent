"""What a contribution says about the settlement, including when there was none.

A series that reached its last sub-game and a series that was *mutually settled*
are different facts, and rule 35 scores the difference. The evidence has to be
able to tell them apart, so the digest is written when one arrived and the key is
absent when none did - never a `null` that reads as "settled with nothing".
