"""The one place a pushed turn waits, and what it is allowed to wake.

The symmetric-push wire means the opponent's turn arrives on our own inbound
server while the game loop is somewhere else entirely. This is the seam between
them, and its whole job is to make sure the loop is woken by exactly what it is
owed: an authoritative newly accepted message, never every HTTP arrival.

A tolerated duplicate proves the opponent is alive and discharges nothing, so it
must not wake the loop and must not renew its deadline - one clock per expected
message, so a stall burns the sender's budget rather than ours.
