"""The one boundary a development friendly must never be able to cross.

The pinned kit's `SHA256(canonical(terms)|nonce)` is an **unkeyed content
agreement**: anyone holding the terms and the nonce recomputes it, so it proves
both sides read the same fourteen values and nothing about who is speaking. The
book requires Step-0 to be cryptographically authenticated with a pre-supplied
key, and this project satisfies that with `HMAC_SHA256`.

A friendly run against the pinned peer is therefore authorized to play **without
that gate**, and is authorized for nothing else. `counted_capable` is a derived
property rather than a stored flag precisely so no constructor, no operator and
no later edit can set it true on a friendly run.
