"""What an alternating counted series may and may not report, and why not yet.

A real counted series against `s82kma9e` played six sub-games, completed six
mutual audits, settled bidirectionally and wrote exactly fourteen official files
- and the lecturer was never mailed. `SeriesDriver._report` is unreachable in an
alternating series: one process never sees the whole thing.

The gateway now hands the written result to the same reporter an operator would
invoke. It is refused, and these pin **why**: a result becomes eligible only
once both participants' own `ResultContribution`s exist, and the pinned KIT
external `receive_control` is a status signal that returns `{"ok": true}` and
carries no contribution and no digest. An absent peer contribution is never
replaced by a manufactured one, so the agreement stays incomplete and the normal
gate refuses - which is the honest state of a result nobody agreed.
