"""Where a group's series-wide artifacts are assembled, and what licenses them.

The backend that owns sub-game six is the one that reaches a matching consensus
digest with the peer, but it cannot render the result: that needs the merged
declaration, which only the gateway holds. So the digest travels and the result
is rendered once, by the process that has both.
