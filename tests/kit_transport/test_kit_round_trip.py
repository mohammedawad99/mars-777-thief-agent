"""The acceptance proof: four pinned calls over real FastMCP HTTP, and back.

Nothing here calls a router function. A test client speaks only the pinned
KIT-shaped public messages over Streamable HTTP, exactly as a stranger's peer
would, and the assertions are about what the **application** received - a
transport that accepted everything and delivered nothing would pass a status
check and fail here.

`RecordingOperations` stands in for the game runtimes on purpose: it is the
seam a production process fills with `InboundPeerOperations`, whose
authentication gate is proved against the production adapter elsewhere and is
deliberately not weakened for this proof.
