"""A held backend session that dies, and the one thing that may be retried.

Holding one session per role is deliberate - Stage 4E measured thirty operations
each opening their own session failing from the twenty-first onward - but a cache
that never reopens turns a single dropped connection into a backend that is
unreachable for the rest of the series.

The line these tests defend: a **transport** failure is a broken wire and a fresh
session is the repair; a **backend refusal** is a decision, and retrying it would
only hide it.
