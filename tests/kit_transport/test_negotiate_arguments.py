"""The three agreed spellings of `negotiate`, and what each one means.

The pairing froze `{"tool":"negotiate","kind":"step0"}` and never said whether
`kind` and `payload` were top-level MCP arguments or nested inside `request`.
Both teams implemented to the letter and to different shapes; a live rehearsal
Step-0 was rejected at input validation *before* authentication - no HMAC
checked, no sub-game started, no artifact written. Neither reading was wrong, so
both are accepted and this file is what keeps that true.
