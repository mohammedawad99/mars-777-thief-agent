"""A bad-HMAC Step-0 must be refused by authentication, never by the schema.

The distinction is the whole point. A live rehearsal once had its Step-0
rejected at input validation *before* authentication - no HMAC checked, no
sub-game started - and the peer could not tell a shape disagreement from a key
disagreement, because both arrive as a rejected call. So the argument boundary
has to let a structurally valid Step-0 through, and the keyed authority has to be
the thing that says no.

These drive the real public tool over a real MCP session and assert on which
layer refused, not merely that something did.
