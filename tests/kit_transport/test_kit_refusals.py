"""What the KIT profile refuses, and the one live outbound proof.

Two halves of the same rule. A message that does not conform is refused at the
boundary and reaches no runtime - decided before any state change, because an
inbound message is adversarial input and a partly applied bad one cannot be
rolled back. And a process that never registered the KIT surface cannot put a
KIT message on the wire at all: the arguments are refused where they are built.

The outbound half runs against a real KIT ingress over HTTP, so what is proved
is a round trip through the production client, the production registration and
the production router - not a helper calling a codec.
