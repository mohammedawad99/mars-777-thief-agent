"""The two operator inputs permanent boot needs, and where each of them lives.

A process that plays by itself has to be told two things the serving process
never needed: **which config to open the negotiation with**, and **where its
official artifacts go**. They are deliberately given different homes.

The config candidate is a *series* fact, so it joins the launch document - and
it arrives in the frozen `NegotiatedConfigWire` shape the transport already
validates, so no second config schema exists anywhere. It is a **candidate**,
not an agreement: the peer still has to converge, and `ConfigLockRuntime` still
refuses a digest that differs.

The artifact root is a *local filesystem* fact, so it joins settings, which
`CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md` already makes the boundary for operator-local values.
It is never negotiated, never hashed and never crosses the wire.
