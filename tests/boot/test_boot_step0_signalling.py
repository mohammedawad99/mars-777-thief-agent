"""When Step-0 is signalled, and what a signal without state would mean.

The peer's Step-0 had no awaitable moment at all until Stage 6C-C2 gave it one,
and the defect that hid behind that is the reason these exist: a signal must
follow the state it announces, never precede it, and one that arrived before we
were listening must not be missed.
