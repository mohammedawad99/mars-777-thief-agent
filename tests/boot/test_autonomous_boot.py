"""The permanent boot path: serve, connect, Step-0, one series, stop.

Stage 6C-C1 proved a production `SeriesDriver` plays six sub-games; the shipped
`python -m` process still only served and waited. This is the layer between
them, and it owns **process lifecycle only**: readiness, a bounded outbound
connection, our Step-0, the wait for the peer's, exactly one `play_series`, and
a shutdown that runs whatever happened.

Every gameplay decision stays where 6C-C1 put it. The tests below therefore
assert *sequence and ownership*, never a move, an outcome or a cadence.
