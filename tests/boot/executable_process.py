"""Running the real executable from a test, and judging how it stopped.

Everything here exists for one consumer - the `python -m` tests - and it is all
mechanics rather than assertions: how to start the process on either platform,
how to know its *application* is answering rather than just its socket, what an
operator's stop looks like, and what "cleanly" means on the platform running.

The launch document and operator environment live here too, because a subprocess
is the only thing that needs them written to disk and exported.
