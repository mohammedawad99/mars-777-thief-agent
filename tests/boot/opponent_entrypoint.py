"""A **synthetic, non-counted** opponent process for the boot integration tests.

This is not another team, not a league participant and not tournament evidence.
It exists for exactly one reason: the shipped CLI is `MaRs-777`, and Step-0
correctly refuses a peer that authors our own participant subtree, so a real
process-level proof needs a counterparty with a *different* group id. That
identity is supplied here, by test construction, and never by the shipped
entrypoint - `GROUP_CODE` stays `MaRs-777` in both role repositories and
anti-self-play is untouched.

Everything else it runs is production: the real composition, the real transport,
the real `AutonomousBoot`, the real `SeriesDriver` and the repository's own
`StrategyPort`. It chooses its own actions and gives this process nothing but
protocol messages.

Guarded under `__main__` so Windows' spawn start method re-imports it safely,
and it sets up its own paths because a child process gets no conftest.
