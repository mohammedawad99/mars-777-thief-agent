"""The shipped CLI, as a real OS process, booting itself against a real peer.

**What this proves.** `python -m mars777_thief --launch …` serves, reaches an
opponent that may not be up yet, exchanges Step-0, runs one production
`SeriesDriver` to the end of a six-sub-game series, writes its own fourteen
official files and exits 0 - with no fixture supplying an action, an outcome or
a lifecycle call, and no shared object between the two processes.

**What this deliberately does not prove.** The counterparty is a *synthetic,
non-counted integration opponent* (`opponent_entrypoint`) playing the police
side, not another team.
The shipped CLI is `MaRs-777` and Step-0 refuses a peer authoring our own
subtree, so a lawful counterparty must carry a different group id - supplied by
test construction, never by the shipped entrypoint. **This is not a league
match and its result is not tournament evidence.** A counted proof needs an
externally supplied different-group agent.

The parent here only writes boot inputs, starts processes, observes readiness,
waits, and reads artifacts afterwards. It sends no protocol message.
