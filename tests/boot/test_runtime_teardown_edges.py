"""Which socket-level teardown failures end a run, and which are its ending.

When a run is over, Windows' proactor aborts the outstanding operations of the
session being closed and reports `WinError 995`. The series has already finished
by then, so letting that turn a completed run into a failed process would be a
lie about what happened. It is recognised by the verified error number and by
nothing else - no platform test, no error class, no message.
