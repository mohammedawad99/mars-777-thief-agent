"""The counted gateway must report the series it just wrote, and only then.

`SeriesDriver._report` covers the fixed-role path, where one process plays the
whole series. An alternating counted series never reaches it - the group's two
backends each hold three sub-games and only the gateway holds the series - so a
real counted game against `s82kma9e` wrote all fourteen files and mailed nobody.

These drive `series_writer` exactly as `compose_gateway` does, with an injected
reporter, so nothing here can reach Gmail or a lecturer.
