"""What the series gate does with a replay's finding.

The gate has always recorded one outcome per sub-game. What it records now is
the hashes *and* the replay, which splits the two failures apart: a forged game
blocks the series exactly as a failed digest does, while a wrong declaration
leaves a verified series verified and is paid for in points instead.
