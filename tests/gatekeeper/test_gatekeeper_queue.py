"""The bounded FIFO a rate-limited caller waits in.

Guideline §5.3: when the limits are reached the gate **queues** rather than
rejecting or crashing - FIFO, a depth from configuration, backpressure when it
is full, and a drain that serves waiters as the windows reset. Rejection is what
happens at the boundary, not instead of the queue.
