"""Which calls go through the gate, and which must never be dragged into it.

This is a structural guard, not a comment. The excellence guideline §5.1 wants
every **provider** call centralised; the project's own delivery contract wants
peer gameplay left exactly where it is, because a generic resend of a turn the
opponent already applied is a protocol violation and a generic queue would break
lockstep. Both halves are asserted from the source tree.
