"""Two commitments per step, two nonces per step, and no false accusation.

Every lockstep step carries both sides' commitments, and `final_reveal` labels
each released nonce with the role it belongs to. A nonce map keyed by step alone
lets the second entry overwrite the first, after which one whole side's
commitments are recomputed with somebody else's nonce and reported as
`TAMPERED`. That is a false accusation of cheating in the very tool a grader is
told to run, so it is pinned here rather than left to a fixture's shape.
