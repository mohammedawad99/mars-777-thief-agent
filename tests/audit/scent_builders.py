"""Real scent fixtures for the audit: real model, real emissions, no hand-made maps.

Every emission here comes from `emission_of` under the agreed model, so a test
that says "two emissions differ" is asserting the physics disagreed rather than
that a literal was typed differently. The documents are rendered by the real
`audit_disclosure_writer`, so what a test parses is what a peer would actually
have to send.
