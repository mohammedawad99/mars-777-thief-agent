"""One classification per turn, even when a peer spells it twice.

C-08 settled that the book's English code comment `verdict` and its Hebrew prose
`intent classification` name the **same** commit-time value, and that the sealed
payload carries `intent` alone. The reference implementation nonetheless writes
both keys with the same value, so a disclosure may legally arrive carrying the
pair - and PRD04-FR-018 requires that when it does, they must agree.

**This is parser consistency, not a new game rule.** A contradiction is a
malformed document on the existing refusal path: it creates no tampering
verdict, no technical loss and no sanction. `RevealWire`, `H_commit` and the
compatibility profile are untouched, and a document without `verdict` behaves
exactly as it always has - the key is still not an input to anything.
