"""Writing the scent into a document, and reading a hostile one back out.

The writer and the reader are a deliberate pair: what our own disclosure emits is
exactly what a peer's `AuditRuntime` parses, with nothing adapted on the way. One
member is added beside `capture`, carrying the turn and the deposits and nothing
that would locate anybody.

Intensities cross as canonical decimal text through the one shared authority the
transport adapter also delegates to, so `0.10` survives as `0.10` and a binary
float never becomes a value at all. The deposits are handed to the domain's own
`ScentEmission`, so ordering, uniqueness and positivity are judged exactly once,
where they already live - this module never restates a scent rule.
