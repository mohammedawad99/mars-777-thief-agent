"""The value the scent history is made of, and where the inbound one lives.

Two members and no third. The sub-game and the sender are already identified by
the document that carries these rows, where the emitter stood is sealed until the
audit, and whether an emission is *physically* right is a different question from
whether it is the one that was sent - so a role, a source cell, a model or a
verdict here would be either duplicated identity or an answer to a question this
value is not asking.

The inbound rows are not stored at all: `TurnEvidence.scent` has been the
authority since Reveal V2 and the audit projects them from it, so there is no
second history to drift from the one that was witnessed.
