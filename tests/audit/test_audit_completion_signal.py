"""Knowing *when* this side's final audit is complete, without owning the fact.

A sub-game cannot be closed until this process has accepted the peer's audit
disclosure - `semantic_review` needs the peer's own positions and refuses
without them. In one interpreter that ordering arrived for free, because both
drivers interleave in a single event loop. Two independent OS processes do not
provide it: whichever reaches closure first finds `disclosure` still `None` and
raises `E-LOCAL-DEFECT`.

So the audit gains a **signal**, not a second truth. `AuditRuntime` still owns
the nonce batch, the disclosure, the verdict and the phase; the event only says
that all of them are already installed - which is why it is set last.

**One signal is enough, and the existing contract is why.** A disclosure is
refused unless the phase is `AWAITING_DISCLOSURE`, and only the accepted nonce
batch moves the phase there. `COMPLETE` therefore implies both arrivals, in
order, so no separate `final_nonce_seen` event has to exist.
