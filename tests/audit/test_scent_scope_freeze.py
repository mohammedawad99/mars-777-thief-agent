"""What retaining the scent history deliberately did **not** change.

A new member on the disclosure document is the kind of change that quietly grows:
into the sealed record, into the log artifact, into a new semantic finding, into a
sanction. None of that happened here, and this file is where that is asserted
rather than promised.

The capture transcript in particular has to keep failing as *itself*: two
independent correspondence checks over one document must not collapse into one
message, or a peer could learn which lie it was caught in from the wrong error.
