# mars-777-thief-agent

**2026 Distributed Police-Thief Peer-to-Peer — Final Project**

- **Group code:** `MaRs-777`
- **Repository role:** **THIEF**
- **Companion repository:** **POLICE** — https://github.com/mohammedawad99/mars-777-police-agent (private)
- **Status:** an autonomous agent. `uv run python -m mars777_thief …` boots,
  serves its four FastMCP tools, reaches its opponent, plays a complete
  six-sub-game series and exits. It has also played six live sub-games against a
  third party's independent implementation. What it has **not** done is play a
  **counted** match against another group's agent.

This README is the user manual. Sections 1–3 say what the system is, 4–9 are the
operator manual, 10–14 are the engineering and programmatic surface, and 15–19
are the honest boundary of what is and is not done.

---

## 1. What the system is

Two teams each run two agents. A POLICE and a THIEF from **different** groups
meet over the public network, authenticate, negotiate and cryptographically lock
a shared configuration, then play a **series of exactly six sub-games** in
lockstep. Every action is committed before it is revealed, so neither side can
choose its move after seeing the other's. When the series ends, both sides hold
artifacts from which an auditor can re-derive the whole match.

### 1.1 Decision-process formulation (Dec-POMDP)

The match is modelled as a **decentralised partially-observable Markov decision
process** — two agents, no shared runtime state, each acting on its own partial
view.

| Element | This game |
|---|---|
| Agents `I` | `{police, thief}` — two processes, two repositories, no shared memory |
| States `S` | police cell, thief cell, the set of placed barriers, the police barrier quota consumed, the scent field, the move index within the sub-game, the sub-game index within the series, and the running score |
| Actions `A_i` | `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, `STAY`. Barrier placement is the **police**'s alone (`BAR-004`); the thief has no such action and this package refuses to construct one |
| Transition `T` | **deterministic** given the acting agent's action; there is no environment noise. Agents alternate rather than act simultaneously, so on the other side's turn an agent's action is a no-op |
| Observations `Ω_i` | own cell; the public board, i.e. every placed barrier; own remaining barrier quota where the role has one; the scent emissions the opponent has **disclosed**; the opponent's hint sentence and its declared intent |
| Observation function `O` | **partial and asymmetric.** The opponent's cell is *never* observable. Scent is evidence about the environment the opponent passed through, not about where it is now |
| Reward `R` | the sub-game outcome — capture (police), survival (thief), timeout, or technical loss — scored by the negotiated scoring table and accumulated across the six sub-games |
| Horizon | finite: the negotiated step ceiling per sub-game (Appendix F minimum **35**), six sub-games per series |

The partial observability is the whole problem: the thief must survive the step
ceiling against an opponent whose position it cannot see, on a board the police
is actively reshaping with barriers, while its own movement leaves scent behind.

### 1.2 Where the two repositories differ

Both repositories implement the same protocol, the same cryptography and the
same board. They differ only in **role**: which side they may play, which
actions are legal for them, and which strategy they compose. Neither imports the
other, and the environment cannot make this package boot as a thief.

---

## 2. Implementation status

Stated precisely, because "done" and "not done" are both misleading here.

### Implemented, covered by tests, and exercised in real processes

- **Game mechanics** — board, orthogonal movement, `STAY`, barrier placement and
  quota, capture, scoring, terminal conditions.
- **Protocol** — the state machine, per-transition evidence, the sub-game cursor,
  the delivery contract (apply / absorb / equivocation / buffer / violation /
  discard) and settlement that is **signalled, never inferred**.
- **Cryptography** — commit–reveal over SHA-256, sealed eight-member record,
  CSPRNG nonces, keyed Step-0 and configuration authentication, final nonce
  reveal, commitment recomputation, `TAMPERED` on mismatch, golden vectors.
- **Transport** — FastMCP over HTTP: four tools carrying nine frozen message
  kinds, strict DTOs, and **two envelope profiles** chosen before boot (see §10).
- **Autonomy** — the shipped CLI boots, connects, exchanges Step-0, plays
  `g01`…`g06` against a separate OS process, writes its fourteen official
  artifacts and exits 0.
- **Language and scent** — a deterministic hint channel (template catalogue,
  validator, zero tokens, no model, no network) and belief-level interpretation
  of the opponent's disclosed scent.
- **Strategy** — see §11.
- **Public network** — the group gateway and the tunnel adapter are wired behind
  one stable public route, with a ten-check readiness gate and proven teardown.
  **Demonstrated end to end**, including role handoff on a live public URL.
- **Third-party interoperability** — six live sub-games against the pinned
  interoperability kit, including the settlement divergence that exposed a real
  defect on our side (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`).
- **Replay Viewer** — a command that replays a finished sub-game from the
  artifacts alone and verifies every commitment (§6.4).
- **Graphical interface** — a live window showing local truth and the belief
  heatmap, and a replay window showing both agents and the verification result
  (§6.5). Both are read-only and neither is on the decision path.
- **Gmail result reporting** — the agreed result artifact is mailed to the fixed
  lecturer address as a JSON attachment, behind a token-bucket Gatekeeper that
  honours `429` (§6.6). **No real message has been sent**: sending needs an
  operator credential and an explicit authorisation, and CI can never send.

### Not implemented

- a **counted match against another group's agent** — the runs above used either
  a synthetic distinct-group non-counted opponent or the interoperability kit in
  a friendly, explicitly non-counted mode;
- **enforcement** of the negotiated rate limits — the terms are negotiated,
  validated and locked, but no component applies them at call time;
- a **strategy candidate that beats the frozen baseline** — Stage 9B-0 built and
  froze the laboratory that would judge one; no candidate exists yet;
- the **analysis notebook** — every statistic is a tested function and one
  command regenerates every table and figure, so the guideline's *"or
  equivalent"* is met; a Jupyter surface on top is deferred rather than added as
  a large optional dependency.

The project is therefore neither "foundation only" nor "complete", and this
section is the authoritative boundary.

## 3. System requirements

| Requirement | Value |
|---|---|
| Python | **3.12** exactly (`.python-version`, `requires-python = "==3.12.*"`) |
| Package manager | **`uv`** — mandatory; `pip`, `venv` and `virtualenv` are not used |
| Operating system | Linux or Windows; CI proves both on every push |
| Network | outbound HTTPS for a real match; loopback only for local play |
| Tunnel (real match only) | an `ngrok` agent installed and authenticated **by the operator** |
| Disk | ~200 MB for the virtual environment; artifacts are a few hundred KB per series |

## 4. Installation

```bash
uv sync --frozen      # create .venv and install exactly what uv.lock pins
```

`--frozen` is the reproducible form: it refuses to silently re-resolve. Drop it
only when deliberately changing dependencies.

Verify the installation:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

### Installing the built distribution

```bash
uv build
uv pip install dist/mars_777_thief_agent-1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

The wheel ships a PEP 561 `py.typed` marker, so a consumer of the SDK gets the
same strict types this project is checked with rather than being told the
package is untyped. It also installs six console scripts:

| command | equivalent module form |
|---|---|
| `mars777-agent` | `python -m mars777_thief` |
| `mars777-backend` | `python -m mars777_thief.kit_backend_main` |
| `mars777-gateway` | `python -m mars777_thief.kit_gateway_main` |
| `mars777-gui` | `python -m mars777_thief.gui_main` |
| `mars777-replay` | `python -m mars777_thief.replay_main` |
| `mars777-report` | `python -m mars777_thief.report_main` |

Both forms work and take identical arguments; the examples below use the module
form because it also works straight from a source checkout. The `--help` banner
names the module form for that reason.

**The research commands are not installed.** `research/` is development
evidence, lives outside the distributed package, and a tournament agent never
needs it to play.

## 5. Environment setup

Copy the committed template and fill it in locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MARS777_ROLE` | yes | `thief` for this repository. Boot refuses any other value |
| `MARS777_BIND_HOST` | yes | interface to listen on — loopback for local play |
| `MARS777_BIND_PORT` | yes | port to listen on |
| `MARS777_OPPONENT_ENDPOINT` | yes | the opponent's MCP URL |
| `MARS777_KEY_ID` | yes | names the pre-shared authentication key |
| `MARS777_AUTH_SECRET` | yes | the pre-shared secret itself. **Never committed**, never printed, never passed on the command line |
| `MARS777_ARTIFACT_ROOT` | yes | where this process writes **its own** official artifacts |
| `MARS777_RUN_LIVE_NGROK` | no | set to `1` to enable the live tunnel test suite |

The tunnel credential is **not** in this list on purpose: this project never
reads a tunnel token. It relies on the operator's own `ngrok` configuration, so
the credential never enters our process arguments, environment or logs.

## 6. Usage

### 6.1 Local strict series (two processes, one machine)

The internal wire, used for development and for the project's own artifacts:

```bash
# terminal 1 — this repository
uv run python -m mars777_thief --launch <launch.json>

# terminal 2 — the police repository
uv run python -m mars777_police --launch <launch.json>
```

Each process serves, dials the other, exchanges Step-0, plays six sub-games,
writes fourteen artifacts and exits 0.

### 6.2 Interoperability (kit) mode

To speak the pinned third party's wire instead of ours, select the profile
**before boot** — it is never negotiated, because a wire cannot be agreed by the
messages whose encoding it governs:

```bash
uv run python -m mars777_thief --launch <launch.json> --external-mode KIT_CORE_V1
```

### 6.3 Public match (role-split, one public URL)

A real match exposes **one** stable group URL that routes to whichever role is
playing the current sub-game:

```bash
# one backend per role, each in its own repository
uv run python -m mars777_thief.kit_backend_main \
    --launch <doc> --port <private port> \
    --opponent <their public url> \
    --gateway-admin http://127.0.0.1:<admin port>/mcp \
    --first-role <police|thief>

# the group's public front door
uv run python -m mars777_thief.kit_gateway_main \
    --police-endpoint <private> --thief-endpoint <private> \
    --ngrok <path to ngrok> --first-role <police|thief>
```

The full operator procedure, including what to check before and after the match,
is `docs/reference/MATCH_RUNBOOK.md`.

### 6.4 Replaying a finished game

Any grader or operator can replay a sub-game from the artifacts alone and see it
verified step by step:

```bash
uv run python -m mars777_thief.replay_main \
    --log <log artifact> --config <config artifact> [--summary] [--step N]
```

Exit status `0` means every source-required commitment was present and matched,
`2` that the evidence could not be read, `3` that the replay **found** something
(a mismatch or an illegal step), and `4` that the audit is **incomplete** — a
commitment whose nonce was never disclosed. Absence is never reported as
tampering. Full guide: `docs/reference/REPLAY_VIEWER.md`.

### 6.5 Watching a match, and replaying one in a window

The same evidence, drawn instead of printed:

```bash
# step through a finished sub-game (arrow keys, Home, End)
uv run python -m mars777_thief.gui_main replay \
    --log <log artifact> --config <config artifact>

# the same picture written to a file — needs no display at all
uv run python -m mars777_thief.gui_main replay \
    --log <log> --config <config> --step 5 --png shot.png

# watch this agent play a counted series
uv run python -m mars777_thief.gui_main live --launch <launch document>
```

`--png` needs no display and no window toolkit, so it works on any machine. The
interactive window needs `tkinter`, which Debian and Ubuntu package separately
(`sudo apt install python3-tk`); without it the command exits `2` with that
remedy rather than a traceback.

The live window shows **local truth only** — own cell, declared barriers, the
belief heatmap and its numbers, the received hint, and the turn-state banner. It
never shows the opponent's position, because the value it draws is projected
from the same `Observation` the strategy is restricted to and has no field one
could arrive in. The replay window may show both agents, because the audit point
has passed. Neither window has a control that reaches a decision. Full guide:
`docs/reference/GUI.md`.

### 6.6 Reporting a finished game

**Reporting is automatic, and needs no command.** Appendix E rule 32 requires the
result of every legal game to be reported automatically, and rule 35 makes each
group's own report the condition for being credited at all - non-reporting
scores **0 for both groups**. So when a counted series reaches its legal
reporting boundary - six sub-games played, mutual audits `CONSISTENT`, result
agreed with the opponent and persisted - the agent sends the report itself,
immediately, with nobody typing anything.

Exactly one MaRs-777 process ever does this: every profile set this project
composes fixes `SeriesConvention.FIXED_ROLE`, and a config lock is refused unless
the peer agreed the same convention, so one process plays a counted series and
one report leaves the group. A restart cannot send it twice - the durable
delivery record is consulted before any send.

The command below remains as an **operator recovery tool** for the case where
delivery failed and the provider must be retried. It is no longer the normal
post-game path.

At the end of every legal game each group sends its own completion report to the
lecturer, as an attached JSON file (Appendix E rules 32-35 and 51):

```bash
uv run python -m mars777_thief.report_main \
    --result artifacts/result_<game_id>.json [--root artifacts]
```

**What is reported** is the agreed result artifact itself, byte-for-byte — the
same `result_<game_id>.json` the series wrote after both sides agreed, carried as
the message's **only** part. There is no covering text: Appendix E rule 34 makes
the attachment the report, and a body could only restate it or give an automated
grader non-JSON text to trip over. Nothing about the game is recomputed to build
the email.

**When** is after the mutual audit and the result agreement, never before: a
result that does not record `mutual_agreement` is refused, so a friendly or KIT
run can never be reported as a counted game.

**To whom** is `rmisegal+uoh26finalgame@gmail.com`, which Appendix F Table 20
fixes and marks non-negotiable. It is a constant in the code; no setting can
redirect it.

**Rate limiting** is the token bucket Appendix E rule 28 names —
`tokens ← min(C, tokens + r·Δt)`, `allow ⟺ tokens ≥ 1` — with the Quota Manager
and DOS detector Ch 9 §9.3.1 requires beside it, all inside the one Gatekeeper.
A `429` is never retried immediately: it backs off, honours `Retry-After` within
a configured cap, retries a bounded number of times, and then reports failure.

**Credentials** come from the `token.json` that Appendix A's one-time
authorisation produces, named by `MARS777_GMAIL_TOKEN`. They are never
committed, never printed and never needed unless a report is actually being
sent. A scope wider than `gmail.send` is refused.

**Exit status:** `0` the provider accepted it; `2` a local refusal (no
credential, unreadable result, no agreement) printed as a sentence; `3` the
report was eligible but the provider did not accept it, so reporting is
`REPORTING_INCOMPLETE`. A delivery failure never changes who won — the result
artifact is untouched. Full guide: `docs/reference/REPORTING.md`.

### 6.7 Reproducing the competitive research

The benchmark that will judge any future strategy candidate runs entirely
locally and never on CI:

```bash
uv run python -m research.bench_main all --out results
```

That plays every seed bank against the whole opponent and configuration corpus
(6,048 games for this role, about twelve minutes on one core), writes the result
rows, regenerates every table and figure, measures decision latency and rewrites
the manifest. There is no network, no credential and no live game.

**Nothing about the shipped strategy changed to make this possible**, and the
metrics and promotion gates were frozen before any candidate existed. Full
guide: `docs/research/COMPETITIVE_RESEARCH.md`.

### 6.8 Command-line options

| Option | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--launch` | all agent entrypoints | the series launch document: this side's opening configuration candidate and its identity |
| `--external-mode` | `mars777_thief` | `STRICT_INTERNAL` (default) or the kit profile. Chosen pre-boot, never inferred |
| `--port` | `kit_backend_main` | this role's private backend port |
| `--opponent` | `kit_backend_main` | the counterparty's public URL |
| `--gateway-admin` | `kit_backend_main` | the gateway's admin endpoint, used to signal role handoff |
| `--first-role` | backend and gateway | which role plays sub-game 1; roles alternate thereafter |
| `--police-endpoint`, `--thief-endpoint` | `kit_gateway_main` | the two private backends the gateway routes between |
| `--ngrok` | `kit_gateway_main` | path to the operator's ngrok executable |
| `--evidence-root` | friendly runs | where development evidence is written |
| `--png` | `gui_main replay` | write the picture to a file instead of opening a window |
| `--result` | `report_main` | the agreed result artifact to report |
| `--out` | `research.bench_main` | where benchmark rows, tables and figures are written |

### 6.9 Exit status

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | the series completed |
| `2` | local refusal — bad settings or an unreadable launch document |
| `4` | the opponent endpoint never became reachable |
| `5` | the peer refused us for a protocol reason; the frozen error identity is printed, never the payload |
| traceback | a genuine local defect. Deliberately not translated into a friendly code |

## 7. Configuration guide

There are two distinct configuration surfaces, and conflating them is a mistake:

**Negotiated game configuration.** Board geometry, movement set, barrier quota,
step ceiling, survival threshold, scent model, scoring, league terms and the
rate-limiter terms are **proposed, agreed with the peer and cryptographically
locked** at Step-0. They are not local settings and cannot be overridden at
runtime. Appendix F fixes which values are FIXED, which are MINIMUM floors and
which are NEGOTIABLE — for example a `7×7` minimum grid, a **14**-barrier
minimum quota, a **35**-move minimum ceiling, a `5×5` scent field, and exactly
**6** sub-games per series. Field-by-field detail:
`docs/spec/APPENDIX_F_NUMERIC_INVENTORY.md`.

**Local operator settings.** Everything in §5 — where to listen, whom to dial,
which key, where to write. These never cross the wire and are never hashed.

**Local provider limits.** `config/rate_limits.json` is the versioned policy the
API Gatekeeper enforces on calls to external **provider** services: requests per
minute and per hour, concurrent calls, waiting-room depth, retry budget, backoff
and which HTTP statuses may be repeated. Its `rate_limits.version` is validated
at load, and an unsupported version refuses rather than falling back. It is
**ours alone** — it is not negotiated, not hashed, and not the peer's
`rate_limiter_gatekeeper` terms, which are an Appendix-F floor agreed with the
opponent. It contains no secret. Peer gameplay calls are deliberately **not**
governed by it: repeating a turn the opponent has already applied would be a
protocol violation, so they keep their own delivery, ordering and timeout
authorities.

The launch document passed to `--launch` carries this side's *opening candidate*
for the negotiated configuration. It is decoded by the same codec the wire uses,
so there is no second configuration schema.

## 8. Testing and quality

```bash
uv run python tools/check_python_loc.py   # every file <= 150 code lines
uv run python tools/check_infrastructure_freeze.py   # only the strategy surface may move
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy --strict
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
uv build
```

The first command is the file-size gate. It counts code lines the way the
professional-software guideline defines them - blank lines and comment-only
lines excluded, docstrings counted - across **`src/` and `tests/` alike**, and
it is the same command CI runs, so a size failure is never a surprise at push
time.

The coverage gate is `fail_under = 90` in `pyproject.toml`; the suite currently
measures **100%**. CI runs all of the above on Ubuntu and Windows for every push.
Thirteen tests are skipped unless `MARS777_RUN_LIVE_NGROK=1`: they need a real
tunnel and would otherwise fail for an environmental reason rather than a code
one.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `cannot start: MARS777_ROLE contradicts this repository's role` | the thief package was started with `police` | this repository can only be the thief; use the sibling repository |
| `cannot start: …` naming a variable | a required environment variable is missing or malformed | the message names the **variable**, never the value; set it in `.env` |
| exit `4` | the opponent was not listening within the startup budget | start the other side first, or check the endpoint and the tunnel |
| exit `5` with an error identity | the peer refused us for a protocol reason | look the identity up in `docs/architecture/ERROR_MODEL.md` |
| the live ngrok tests all skip | `MARS777_RUN_LIVE_NGROK` is unset | that is the intended default; set it to `1` only with a real tunnel |
| `uv sync` wants to re-resolve | the lock and the manifest disagree | run `uv sync --frozen` and fix the manifest deliberately, never by re-resolving silently |
| a settled result disagrees with the peer's | a genuine protocol or rules divergence | do **not** patch the symptom; the settlement divergence of Stage 8A-2R is the worked example in `docs/DECISIONS.md` |

## 10. FastMCP — how the two agents actually talk

The agents communicate over **FastMCP** (Model Context Protocol) carried on
HTTP. Each agent runs an MCP server exposing exactly four tools, and an MCP
client that calls the opponent's:

| Tool | Message kinds it carries |
|---|---|
| `negotiate` | `step0`, `config_proposal`, `config_lock` — identity, keyed authentication and the configuration agreement |
| `receive_turn` | `commitment`, `acknowledgement`, `reveal` — one turn, with its hint and scent emission |
| `submit_audit` | `final_nonce_reveal`, `audit_disclosure` |
| `receive_control` | `result_agreement` |

Four tools, **nine kinds**, no heartbeat and no alias: the matrix is frozen in
`transport/envelopes.py`, and a kind sent to the wrong tool is refused rather
than tolerated.

Two **envelope profiles** exist over those four tools — the project's strict
internal wire and the pinned third-party kit's wire. The profile is selected
before boot and is never auto-detected or downgraded. Framework imports are
confined to the `transport` package, and a test refuses any FastMCP import that
tries to escape it, so the game logic never depends on the framework.
Architecture: `docs/architecture/API_BOUNDARIES.md`.

## 11. Strategies

Two strategy artefacts exist behind one `StrategyPort`, so swapping them changes
no other code.

**`BaselineStrategy` (Stage 6B, extended 7C) — what this repository ships.**
From own position, the public board and the negotiated terms it chooses a legal
deterministic action by an accessibility objective: prefer the action that keeps
the thief's reachable region largest, which is what surviving the step ceiling
on a board the police is closing actually requires. Since Stage 7C, when that
objective **ties**, the belief folded from the opponent's own disclosed scent
emissions breaks the tie. No opponent position, no LLM, no randomness.

**The Stage 7D-B competitive candidate was rejected.** A thief-side counterpart
to the police barrier policy was built and benchmarked at the same time, and it
**failed its promotion gate** — it did not beat the baseline on the development
benchmark. It was therefore not shipped, and this repository runs the frozen
baseline. Recording a rejected candidate is the point: a strategy is promoted on
evidence or not at all.

**`NO_CHANGE` is this repository's final strategy decision, and it is a
result.** The Stage-9B benchmark measured the shipped policy at a win rate of
**0.9886, 95% CI [0.9856, 0.9914]**, over **4,988 independent scenarios**. Six
of the seven opponent families sit at a perfect **1.0000**; only the two
barrier-using families lose anything at all — `adversarial_corner` 0.9495 and
`barrier_aware` 0.9705, on N=713 each. There is no identified mechanism for
recovering the remaining ~1.1 points, and changing a policy that near the
measurable ceiling would spend real regression risk for it. The decision was
**re-derived after** the Stage-9B-0F methodology correction rather than
inherited from the flawed first measurement.

**This repository ships no barrier policy at all.** `BAR-004` gives placement to
the police alone; a thief that disclosed one would be judged `ILLEGAL_ACTION`
and lose the sub-game. The competitive barrier research that produced the police
agent's promoted rule belongs to that repository and is not restated here as
though it were this agent's work.

**On "learning curves".** `DOC-001` component (4) asks for learning curves **if
reinforcement learning is used** (`docs/spec/REQUIREMENT_CATALOG.md`, PDF
p.97/134/148, Appendix E-42). None is used — nothing is trained, and there is no
model, epoch, gradient or reward — so that component is **conditionally not
applicable**, and inventing a loss curve would be a fabricated result. The
measured evidence above is presented instead; see
`notebooks/strategy_research.ipynb`.

## 12. Screenshots and demonstrations

Both pictures below were produced by the **real** renderer from **one**
thirty-five-round sub-game two composed agents actually played in this
repository. Neither is drawn, mocked, or a diagram of an application, and
neither shows a secret, a token or a private path.

### The live window — local truth and the belief heatmap

![Live window showing this agent's own cell, a belief heatmap with per-cell
values, the turn-state banner, and the statement that the opponent position is
never shown](docs/evidence/gui/live_belief_map.png)

`GUI-001` and `GUI-003`. Own cell (`ME`), the folded belief map with every
heated cell carrying its own number, the barrier quota, the last action, the
received hint, and the two statements that make the limit explicit —
`belief (estimate) - not a sighting` and `opponent position: never shown`. There
is no opponent cell on this screen because the value it is drawn from has no
field one could arrive in (`GUI-002`).

### The replay window — verification of the same sub-game

![Replay window showing both agents' true cells, Verified OK for both sides with
an OK glyph, a CONSISTENT semantic verdict, and audit complete
yes](docs/evidence/gui/replay_verified.png)

`REPLAY-001`, `REPLAY-002` and `PRD07-FR-023`. **After** the audit point, and
only then, both agents' true cells may be shown. Every verification word carries
a glyph as well as a colour, so `Verified OK`, `TAMPERED` and `NOT_CHECKABLE`
stay distinguishable without colour.

The identities in both pictures (`MaRs-777-vs-GROUP-XY`) are **development
identities**. This was not a tournament match and is not presented as one.

Regenerate both from a fresh run:

```bash
MARS777_WRITE_GUI_EVIDENCE=1 uv run pytest tests/gui/test_gui_evidence.py
```

## 13. Programmatic use — the SDK

Everything this agent can do is reachable from one import path. The command
lines shipped here use it, and so would a graphical interface, a replay viewer,
or any third party who installed the distribution.

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path

from mars777_thief.sdk import AgentSdk, StrictSeriesRequest

sdk = AgentSdk()  # verifies this installation is this source
artifacts = asyncio.run(sdk.run_strict_series(StrictSeriesRequest(launch=Path("launch.json"))))
```

| Operation | What it does |
|---|---|
| `run_strict_series(request)` | plays one complete series and returns where the artifacts were written |
| `compose_role_backend(request)` | assembles this role's friendly backend; nothing is served or dialled |
| `write_contribution(backend, root)` | writes a finished backend's development evidence and says where |
| `compose_public_gateway(request)` | assembles the group's public front door; no route is opened yet |
| `verify_config_artifact(document)` | returns what a stored config artifact proves, or refuses it |
| `open_replay(log, config, root)` | returns a navigable, already-verified replay of one finished sub-game |
| `verify_replay(log, config, root)` | returns that replay's summary alone, for a caller that only wants the verdict |
| `read_game_report(result, root)` | returns the report an agreed result makes eligible; reaches no provider |
| `send_game_report(result, root)` | sends one game report to the fixed lecturer address, through the gate |

The requests (`StrictSeriesRequest`, `RoleBackendRequest`, `PublicGatewayRequest`)
and the failures a caller must tell apart (`SettingsError`, `LaunchInputError`,
`TransportFailureError`, `PeerProtocolError`, `LocalDefectError`,
`PublicIngressError`, `SoftwareVersionError`) are exported from the same place.
The names in `mars777_thief.sdk.__all__` are the promise; anything else in the
package is an implementation detail.

**What the SDK is not.** It holds no game rules, no cryptography, no strategy, no
transport and no provider mechanics — it forwards to the layers that own them.

**The live view is a seam, not a screen.** `LiveViewSink`, `LatestSnapshot` and
`LiveViewSnapshot` are exported so a viewer can attach to a running series and
name what it receives; pass one as `StrictSeriesRequest(..., viewer=...)` and
every turn's lawful local view is published to it. The drawing itself lives in
`mars777_thief.gui`, which *consumes* this facade — a presentation package
imported by the facade would point the dependency the wrong way, and would make
every command line load an imaging library in order to parse an argument.

**Software version.** `mars777_thief.sdk.SOFTWARE_VERSION` is the single
authority. It renders two ways — `1.00`, the professional-software guideline's
literal, and `1.0`, the packaging form declared in `pyproject.toml` — from one
stored value, so the two cannot drift.

## 15. Contributing

- **Workflow:** requirement → PRD → PLAN → TODO → implement → verify → review →
  commit → push. Nothing is implemented before an approved plan, and nothing is
  committed or pushed without an explicit instruction.
- **Tests first.** Every implementation stage in this repository was written
  test-first; that is the recorded method, not an aspiration.
- **Style:** ruff (lint **and** format) with zero violations, `mypy --strict`,
  and **no source file over 150 code lines** — split, never compress.
- **Docstrings explain *why*.** A module docstring that only restates the class
  name is not documentation.
- **Never** import the sibling repository, copy its strategy, change
  `GROUP_CODE`, vendor the interoperability kit, or weaken authentication.

Full contributor guidance: `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## 16. Security

Never commit credentials, tokens, OAuth files, private keys or tunnel
configuration. Secrets come from the environment only; the authentication secret
is wrapped in a type whose `repr` and `str` render `<withheld>`, so it cannot
leak into a log line or a traceback. If a secret is ever exposed, revoke it
immediately. Policy: `SECURITY.md`. Threat model:
`docs/architecture/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 17. Isolation statement

This THIEF agent shares **no live state** with the opposing POLICE agent:
separate repository, separate `.venv`, separate process, separate configuration,
logs and runtime state. There is no shared package, database, cache or memory.

## 19. Known limitations

1. No counted match against another group's agent has been played.
2. **No real report has been sent.** Gmail reporting is implemented and proved
   against a fake provider at the adapter seam (Stage 9A-2C), but no live
   message has left this project: that needs an operator credential and an
   explicit one-time authorisation, and CI can never send one.
4. No parameter study, notebook or charts yet (Stage 9B).
5. Thirteen tunnel tests require a real ngrok agent and are skipped by default.
6. One documented Windows-native limitation is isolated in its own CI job so it
   stays visible rather than being hidden by a skip.
7. The version authority covers this **software** only. There is no
   `rate_limits.version` and no local versioned configuration file yet; the
   binding game configuration is negotiated and locked with the peer instead
   (`docs/GUIDELINE_ALIGNMENT.md` §8.1).
